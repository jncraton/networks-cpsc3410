### Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence

The Kissinger Academic Center for Excellence (KACE), located on the ground floor of the
Nicholson Library, provides excellent resources in all areas of study regardless of academic
ability. Many students can benefit from academic support and/or sharpen their skills through
studying with others. In addition, excellent students often maintain their skills by working as
peer tutors. The services are available for all enrolled students at no charge. For information, call

Attendance Policy
-----------------

Class attendance is fundamental to the teaching/learning process and any absence from a class
results in a loss of learning for the student and learning community. It is the student’s obligation
to personally notify the course instructor about any absence, in advance if possible. Students may
be directly penalized only after the number of absences exceeds the number of class meeting
hours per week. Where a student misses more that the number of classes stated above, or
additional absences as may be allotted by the course instructor, the instructor has the discretion
to determine whether missed work may be completed, how much work will be evaluated, and
consequences of excessive absences. Whatever specific policy a given instructor adopts for a
class any penalties should be clearly documented in the course syllabus and reviewed with
students at the beginning of the semester. (Faculty Handbook, Section 4.22.1)
