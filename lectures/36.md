9.3 Infrastructure Applications
===============================

Name Service (DNS)
------------------

Addressing
----------

- IP addresses are used to identify hosts
- They aren't user friendly
- They can change as networks change

Name services
-------------

- Middleware to fill gap between application and network
- Convert human-readable names to addresses

Namespace
---------

- Set of possible names
- Flat namespaces
- Hierarchical namespaces

Resolution Mechanism
--------------------

- Returns the value bindings for a particular name
- Often, this will addresses returned by a *name server*

Early Implementation
--------------------

- When the Internet was small, all hosts managed a mapping of names to addresses
- This can still be found in /etc/hosts on most systems
- Name lookups were performed against this local table

Name servers
------------

- Used to perform name lookups in modern systems
- Track and cache global name mappings

Domain Hierarchy
----------------

- Modern names are broken into domains
- Name servers then service the part of the hierarchy they are responsible for

---

Name resolution
---------------

- Local nameserver is queried
- If it has the appropriate value cached, it returns it
- Otherwise, it queries the appropriate name server

7.2 Multimedia Data
===================

Data Requirements
-----------------

- A modern 4k60 video stream will contain 3840*2160*24*60 = 11.94 gbps of data
- A 2k30 stream will still be over 1 gbps
- This amount of data is not serviceable by mainstream network technologies in use today
- Modern techniques can bring the bandwidth requirements for the stream down to ~30 mbps

Compression
-----------

- Use fewer bytes to transmit information
- Lossless compression - information is transmitted exactly
- Lossy compression - some information is lost

Run-length Encoding
-------------------

- Lossless compression
- Encodes runs of the same type
- AAAAABBBBCDDDDDD -> 5A4B1C6D

Dictionary Methods
------------------

- Lossless compression
- Replace words or phrases with references to words or phrases in a known dictionary

Huffman Code
------------

- Lossless compression
- Use fewer bits for common words and more bits for less common words

Image Compression
-----------------

- Subsampling
- Transforms - DCT, Wavelet, etc
- Quantization
- Encoding

Subsampling
-----------

- Humans are more perceptive to changes in color than brightness
- We can use more pixels for brightness than for color

JPEG Compression
----------------

- Subsampling
- DCT
- Quantization
- Encoding

---

Discrete Cosine Transform
-------------------------

- DCT
- Transforms an image from the 2d dimension to the spatial frequency dimension
- Small changes from one pixel to the next are low frequencies, large changes are high frequencies

Quantization
------------

- DCT is lossless and saves no space
- Quantization rounds the DCT values
- Many values become 0

Encoding
--------

- The order of the DCT values is chosen to maximize long runs of zeroes
- RLE is use on runs of zeroes
- Additional lossless compression is used on remaining values

Video Compression
-----------------

- Apply image compression techniques
- Take advantage of similarity between frames

MPEG Frame Types
----------------

- I-frame - Intrapicture, reference frame, depends on no other frames
- P-frame - Predicted, difference from previous I-frame
- B-frame - Bi-directional predicted, difference from surround I and P frames

---

Macroblocks
-----------

- 8x8 YUV information is stored together in 16x16 macroblocks

---

Representing Predicted Frames
-----------------------------

- 2d array of macroblocks
- Macroblocks include motion vectors to reference frame(s)
- Macroblocks are encoded a different from reference blocks
