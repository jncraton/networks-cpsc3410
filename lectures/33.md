6.5 Quality of Service
======================

QoS
---

- Applications have different needs
- A network that supports these different needs is said to support Quality of Service (QoS)

Requirements
------------

- Bandwidth
- Latency
- Jitter
- Packet loss

---

![Audio Example](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f06-20-9780123850591.png)

Buffering
---------

- Audio is broken into time slices and sent as packets
- Packets are buffered and played back

---

![Playback Buffer](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f06-21-9780123850591.png)

Buffer size
-----------

- A larger buffer will be more resistant to jitter and possibly packet loss
- A larger buffer also induces delay

Application Needs
-----------------

- Real-time vs elastic
- Intolerant to packet loss
- Able to adapt to different level of bandwidth by adjusting rate
- Able to adapt to jitter and latency using larger buffers

---

QoS Approaches
--------------

- Fine-grained - make adjustments by flow or application
- Course-grained - provides different levels of services to large classes of data

Service Classes
---------------

- Best-effort - default service
- Guranteed service - ensures delivery under a maximum delay threshold
- Controlled load - operates like the network is lightly loaded up to a certain bandwidth constraint

Mechanism
---------

- Request service by sending a flowspec
- Admission control determines if service is available
- Packet scheduling works to meet flowspec requirements

Flowspec
--------

- RSpec - requested service
- TSpec - traffic characteristics

Traffic Characteristics
-----------------------

- Maximum delay
- Bandwidth

Bandwidth
---------

- May vary over time (example: compressed video)
- An average and/or upper and lower bound can be useful
- A token bucket can be used to implement an average bandwidth
- Bucket rate communicates average and bucket depth handles bursts

---

![Flows with identical average bitrate but different bucket specs](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f06-24-9780123850591.png)

Admission Control
-----------------

- Only allow new flows we are confident we can service
- Requires knowledge of routing algorithms and network state

Scheduling
----------

- When packets arrive related to a given service, ensure they are delivered meeting the needs of the service
- Can be implement with something like weighted fair queuing or a similar algorithm

Scalability
-----------

- An integrated services model suffers from scalability issues
- This model has not been widely deployed on the Internet

9.1 Traditional Applications
============================

World Wide Web
--------------

- The World Wide Web is not the Internet
- The Internet is a global network of networks connecting most modern computing systems
- The World Wide Web is a set of interconnected hypertext documents

Hypertext
---------

Documents with links to other documents that are immediately accessible

Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
---------------------------------

- A string used to concretely identify a document, image, service, or other resource
- The web commonly uses a specific type of URI called a URL

URL
---

- Includes identification and access mechanism
- Example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
----------------------------------

- Used initially to transmit hypertext documents on the web
- Combines URI with verbs to perform operations

---

+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Operation | Description                                               |
+===========+===========================================================+
| GET       | Retrieve document identified in URL                       |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| POST      | Give information (e.g., annotation) to server             |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| PUT       | Store document under specified URL                        |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
| DELETE    | Delete specified URL                                      |
+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Simple HTTP Request
-------------------

Requests the root document from a host.

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
```

Simple HTTP Response
--------------------

Indicates that the document is not available.

```
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

---

+------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Code | Type          | Example Reasons                                        |
+======+===============+========================================================+
| 1xx  | Informational | request received, continuing process                   |
+------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 2xx  | Success       | action successfully received, understood, and accepted |
+------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 3xx  | Redirection   | further action must be taken to complete the request   |
+------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 4xx  | Client Error  | request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled     |
+------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| 5xx  | Server Error  | server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request   |
+------+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

TCP Connections
---------------

- HTTP is built on top of TCP
- It's usage has evolved between 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0
- HTTP/3 uses QUIC

Caching
-------

- We can improve latency and reduce bandwidth by storing resources that we've already used
- Most browser will manage a cache of previously seen resources and not request them again until they expire
- Proxy and reverse proxy servers can also be used for caching purposes

---

Web Services
------------

- We can use use HTTP to build web services to perform tasks and not merely deliver static documents
- Many standard (WSDL, SOAP) and non-standard mechanisms are used to build interfaces to web services
- Many services build a new protocol on top of HTTP

Representational State Transfer (REST)
--------------------------------------

- Uses standard HTTP verbs to interact with a service at a URL
- Uses custom media types to represent datagrams
- Stateless protocol that does not require the server to maintain per-session state

Threats
-------

- Our systems are designed with trust and threats in mind
- There are usually trade-offs to be made to prevent certain threats on our systems

Encryption
----------

- A function is applied to a *plaintext* message to create a *ciphertext*
- The ciphertext can be read by anyone, but it should only be able to be converted back to the plaintext by then intended parties
- Receivers apply a decryption function to convert the ciphertext back to the plaintext

Secret Key Ciphers
------------------

- Both parties must possess the same secret key
- Examples include DES, Blowfish, and AES
- Solves the encryption problem, but creates a key distribution problem

---

Public-Key Ciphers
------------------

- Address key distribution issues
- Use a private key for decryption, but a public key can be shared with others that is used to create a ciphertext
- Examples in RSA and ECC

---

Public key Authentication
-------------------------

- A private key can also be used to encrypt messages
- These messages can be decrypted using the public key
- This provides no security, but ensures that the sender holds the private key

---

![Public Key Authentication](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f08-04-9780123850591.png)

Authenticator
-------------

- Value included with a message to verify that it has not been tampered with and contains no errors
- Commonly a hashed message authentication code (HMAC)
- HMAC hashes a known secret value appended to the plaintext

---

Example Systems
---------------

SSH
---

- Modern and secure remote access protocol replacing telnet
- Built over TCP adding encryption (often AES)
- Public keys of servers are sent on first connection and stored locally
- Passwords or private keys are used for user authentication

Transport Layer Security
------------------------

- TLS builds on TCP to create an encrypted transport stream
- Handshake negotiates protocols to use
- Secret key is exchanged

Certificate Authority
---------------------

- Provide public key certificates
- Ensures that user is connecting to the system they are expecting to connect to
- Certificates can be purchased, but some services offer free certificates

TLS Benefits
------------

- Encryption - Messages can't be viewed by others
- Authentication - Messages can't be tampered with

Firewall
--------

- Sit between a local network and the outside world blocking unauthorized traffic

Intrusion Detection System
--------------------------

- Monitors the local network for anomalous behavior
- Alerts network administrators to possible threats and attacks
