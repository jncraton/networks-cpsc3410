Application Layer
=================

---

The application layer makes use of transport systems to create networked software programs.

Layers
------

- Application <-- We are here
- Transport
- Network
- Link
- Physical

Domain Name System (DNS)
========================

Names
-----

- We can use IP addresses for contacting services
- IP addresses may change as hosts change network providers
- IP addresses are not memorable
- We'd prefer a nicer system

Hosts files
-----------

- Initially, we simply used a configuration file to map hosts to IP addresses
- This file can still be found on modern systems
- e.g. `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` or `/etc/hosts`

Host-based Ad Blocking
----------------------

- Create a hosts file that maps known ad servers to your local system
- Requests to these hosts are now unable to be completed
- Example: [AdAway Hosts File](https://adaway.org/hosts.txt)

Limitations of Host Files
-------------------------

- Hard to manage and update
- Large local file size

DNS
---

- Manages mapping address to hostname over the entire network
- Servers and responses are arranged hierarchically
