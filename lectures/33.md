Threats
-------

- Our systems are designed with trust and threats in mind
- There are usually trade-offs to be made to prevent certain threats on our systems

Encryption
----------

- A function is applied to a *plaintext* message to create a *ciphertext*
- The cyphertext can be read by anyone, but it should only be able to be converted back to the plaintext by then intended parties
- Receivers apply a decryption function to convert the ciphertext back to the plaintext

Secret Key Ciphers
------------------

- Both parties must possess the same secret key
- Examples include DES, Blowfish, and AES
- Solves the encryption problem, but creates a key distribution problem

Public-Key Ciphers
------------------

- Address key distribution issues
- Use a private key for decryption, but a public key can be shared with others that is used to create a ciphertext
- Examples in RSA and ECC

Public key Authentication
-------------------------

- A private key can also be used to encrypt messages
- These messages can be decrypted using the public key
- This provides no security, but ensures that the sender holds the private key

Authenticator
-------------

- Value included with a message to verify that it has not been tampered with and contains no errors
- Commonly a hashed message authentication code (HMAC)
- HMAC hashes a known secret value appended to the plaintext

Example Systems
---------------

SSH
---

- Modern and secure remote access protocol replacing telnet
- Built over TCP adding encryption (often AES)
- Public keys of servers are sent on first connection and stored locally
- Passwords or private keys are used for user authentication

Transport Layer Security
------------------------

- TLS builds on TCP to create an encrypted transport stream
- Handshake negotiates protocols to use
- Secret key is exchanged

Certificate Authority
---------------------

- Provide public key certificates
- Ensures that user is connecting to the system they are expecting to connect to
- Certificates can be purchased, but some services offer free certificates

TLS Benefits
------------

- Encryption - Messages can't be viewed by others
- Authentication - Messages can't be tampered with

Firewall
--------

- Sit between a local network and the outside world blocking unauthorized traffic

Intrusion Detection System
--------------------------

- Monitors the local network for anomalous behavior
- Alerts network administrators to possible threats and attacks

7.2 Multimedia Data
===================

Data Requirements
-----------------

- A modern 4k60 video stream will contain 3840*2160*24*60 = 11.94 gbps of data
- A 2k30 stream will still be over 1 gbps
- This amount of data is not servicable by mainstream network technologies in use today
- Modern techniques can bring the bandwidth requirements for the stream down to ~30 mbps

Compression
-----------

- Use fewer bytes to transmit information
- Lossless compression - information is transmitted exactly
- Lossy compression - some information is lost

Run-length Encoding
-------------------

- Lossless compression
- Encodes runs of the same type
- AAABBCDDDD -> 3A2B1C4D

Dictionary Methods
------------------

- Lossless compression
- Replace words or phrases with references to words or phrases in a known dictionary

Image Compression
-----------------

- Subsampling
- Transforms - DCT, Wavelet, etc
- Quantization
- Encoding

Subsampling
-----------

- Humans are more perceptive to changes in color than brightness
- We can use more pixels for brightness than for color

JPEG Compression
----------------

- Subsampling
- DCT
- Quantization
- Encoding

---

Discrete Cosine Transform
-------------------------

- DCT
- Transforms an image from the 2d dimension to the spatial frequency dimension
- Small changes from one pixel to the next are low frequencies, large changes are high frequencies

Quantization
------------

- DCT is lossless and saves no space
- Quantization rounds the DCT values
- Many values become 0

Encoding
--------

- The order of the DCT values is chosen to maximize long runs of zeroes
- RLE is use on runs of zeroes
- Additional lossless compression is used on remaining values

Video Compression
-----------------

- Apply image compression techniques
- Take advantage of similarity between frames

MPEG Frame Types
----------------

- I-frame - Intrapicture, reference frame, depends on no other frames
- P-frame - Predicted, difference from previous I-frame
- B-frame - Bi-directional predicted, difference from surround I and P frames

---

Macroblocks
-----------

- 8x8 YUV information is stored together in 16x16 macroblocks

---

Representing Predicted Frames
-----------------------------

- 2d array of macroblocks
- Macroblocks include motion vectors to reference frame(s)
- Macroblocks are encoded a different from reference blocks
