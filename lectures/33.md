8 Network Security
------------------

Threats
-------

- Our systems are designed with trust and threats in mind
- There are usually trade-offs to be made to prevent certain threats on our systems

Encryption
----------

- A function is applied to a *plaintext* message to create a *ciphertext*
- The cyphertext can be read by anyone, but it should only be able to be converted back to the plaintext by then intended parties
- Receivers apply a decryption function to convert the ciphertext back to the plaintext

Secret Key Ciphers
------------------

- Both parties must possess the same secret key
- Examples include DES, Blowfish, and AES
- Solves the encryption problem, but creates a key distribution problem

Public-Key Ciphers
------------------

- Address key distribution issues
- Use a private key for decryption, but a public key can be shared with others that is used to create a ciphertext
- Examples in RSA and ECC

Public key Authentication
-------------------------

- A private key can also be used to encrypt messages
- These messages can be decrypted using the public key
- This provides no security, but ensures that the sender holds the private key

Authenticator
-------------

- Value included with a message to verify that it has not been tampered with and contains no errors
- Commonly a hashed message authentication code (HMAC)
- HMAC hashes a known secret value appended to the plaintext

Example Systems
---------------

SSH
---

- Modern and secure remote access protocol replacing telnet
- Built over TCP adding encryption (often AES)
- Public keys of servers are sent on first connection and stored locally
- Passwords or private keys are used for user authentication

Transport Layer Security
------------------------

- TLS builds on TCP to create an encrypted transport stream
- Handshake negotiates protocols to use
- Secret key is exchanged

Certificate Authority
---------------------

- Provide public key certificates
- Ensures that user is connecting to the system they are expecting to connect to
- Certificates can be purchased, but some services offer free certificates

TLS Benefits
------------

- Encryption - Messages can't be viewed by others
- Authentication - Messages can't be tampered with
