Guided Transmission Media
=========================

---

- Unguided Media - Wireless, Satellite links, etc
- Guided Media - Copper, Fiber, etc

---

Storage Media
-------------

In some cases it may be most cost and time effective to ship physical media.

Effective Bandwidth
-------------------

- 8TB disk driven to Indianapolis in an hour

---

$$ {8 TB \over H} { 1 H \over 3600 s } { 8000 Gb \over TB } = 17.7  {Gb \over s} $$

Twisted Pair
------------

- Twisting limits radiated signal
- Differential signaling avoid external interference

Applications
------------

- Phone line
- Local networks

Types
-----

- Category 3 - ~16MHz, Older LANs
- Category 5 - ~100MHz, Common LANs, more twists
- Category 6 - ~250MHz. Required for Gigabit
- Category 7 - ~600MHz, Required for higher speeds, includes shielding

Coax
----

- High analog bandwidth (several GHz)
- Noise immunity

Uses
----

- Cable TV/Internet
- Phone system backhaul (before fiber was common)

Power Lines
-----------

- Transmit RF signal down existing copper lines
- Low cost, low bandwidth
- Used for low bandwidth communication on power grid
- Sometimes used as backup connection or cheap connection for low bandwidth remote devices

Fiber
-----

---

Three components
----------------

- Light source
- Transmission medium
- Detector

Fiber Types
-----------

- Single mode - Small diameter ~10Âµm, less signal degradation
- Multi mode - Larger diameter

Common Wavelengths
------------------

- .85 micron
- 1.30 micron
- 1.55 micron

Chromatic Dispersion
--------------------

Light in fiber spreads out in time as it travels through the fiber causing signals to interfere

---

Fiber Connections
-----------------

- Fusion Splicing
- Mechanical Splicing
- Connectors

---

Light Sources
-------------

- Laser (expensive, faster, longer distance)
- LED (cheaper, slower, multi-mode only)

Benefits
--------

- Cost (no copper)
- Very high bandwidth (no RF interference)
- Fewer repeaters

Drawbacks
---------

- Harder to work with
- Easier to break
- Expensive interfaces
