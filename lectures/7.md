Effective Bandwidth
-------------------

- 8TB disk driven to Indianapolis in an hour

---

$$ {8 TB \over H} { 1 H \over 3600 s } { 8000 Gb \over TB } = 17.7  {Gb \over s} $$

Twisted Pair
------------

- Twisting limits radiated signal
- Differential signaling avoid external interference

Applications
------------

- Phone line
- Local networks

Types
-----

- Category 3 - Older LANs
- Category 5 - Common LANs, more twists for higher data rate
- Category 6 - Required for Gigabit
- Category 7 - Required for higher speeds, includes shielding
