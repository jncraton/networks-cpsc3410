4.1 Global Internet
===================

---

- Routing as discussed previously provides a somewhat scalable solution for the global Internet
- The modern Internet includes 100,000+ *networks*, so including them all in routing tables is problematic
- We need to create a tighter hierarchy to make the problem more tractable

Scaling Challenges
------------------

- Routing problem size
- IP address space utilization

Routing Areas
-------------

- There are too many individual networks to practically calculate and store routes for all of them
- We group the networks together into areas

Backbone
--------

- Connects areas together
- May be referred to as area 0

Routing Inside Area
-------------------

- Covered in chapter 3
- Routers exchange link-state packets to learn connections and then calculate shortest paths
- Link-state packets are not passed outside of the area

Border Routers
--------------

- Summarize routes from their area and share information with backbone
- An area may have multiple border routers connected to the backbone
- (R1, R2, and R3 in figure)
