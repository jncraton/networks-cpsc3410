4.1 Global Internet
===================

---

- Routing as discussed previously provides a somewhat scalable solution for the global Internet
- The modern Internet includes 100,000+ *networks*, so including them all in routing tables is problematic
- We need to create a tighter hierarchy to make the problem more tractable

Scaling Challenges
------------------

- Routing problem size
- IP address space utilization

Routing Areas
-------------

- There are too many individual networks to practically calculate and store routes for all of them
- We group the networks together into areas

Backbone
--------

- Connects areas together
- May be referred to as area 0

---

Routing Inside Area
-------------------

- Covered in chapter 3
- Routers exchange link-state packets to learn connections and then calculate shortest paths
- Link-state packets are not passed outside of the area

Border Routers
--------------

- Summarize routes from their area and share information with backbone
- An area may have multiple border routers connected to the backbone
- (R1, R2, and R3 in figure)

Interdomain Routing (BGP)
-------------------------

Autonomous Systems (AS)
-----------------------

- The Internet is organized as a collection of networks controlled by a single administrative entity (large corporation, ISPs, etc)
- Provides additional hierarchy to improve scalability

Interdomain Routing Challenges
------------------------------

- Each AS needs to be able to determine its own routing policies
- We want to use our connections for the purpose that we paid for, which may mean avoiding *transit* traffic
- Find non-looping, policy compliant paths

---

AS Types
--------

- Stub - AS with one connection to one other AS
- Multihomed - AS with connection to multiple AS, but that disallows transit traffic
- Transit - AS with multiple connections designed to carry local and transit traffic, such as a backbone

AS Costs
--------

- Internal route costs are meaningless externally, so we only share reachbility as our routing metric

Trust
-----

- We must provide trust in the system
- An AS advertising a route they can't support will break the Internet

Border Gateway Protocol
-----------------------

- Gateway is another name for router
- Protocol handles route communication between AS border routers

---

Route advertizement
-------------------

- BGP speakers advertise complete paths
- Upstream BGP speakers share this information with peers, adding themselves as a hop
- An AS can prevent transit by not advertising available routes that it doesn't want others to use

AS Numbers
----------

- Must be unique
- Currently 32 bit number assigned to an AS

BGP Packets
-----------

- Use TCP for reliability
- May indicate that a route is available or a previous route is withdrawn

Complete Routing
----------------

- We can combine interdomain and intradomain routing to deliver a packet from any host to any other host
- BGP is used to determine routes between AS
- Interior Gateway Protocol (IFG), such as RIP or OSPF is used inside AS
