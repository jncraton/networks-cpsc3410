3.5 Implementation
==================

Software Switch
---------------

- We can create a switch by adding multiple NICs to a general-purpose computer
- All packets must pass through main memory (max bandwidth ~100Gbps)
- Packets must all be processed by a single CPU

Hardware Switch
---------------

- Software switches have limited bandwidth
- We can improve the situation by creating dedicated paralell hardware

Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
------------------------------------------------

- Custom silicon
- Can be very fast for a particular purpose
- Expensive to produce
- Time consuming to design

Domain Specific Processors
--------------------------

- Can be an option in network hardware
- Add instructions and hardware for particular domain tasks (e.g. machine learning, video encoding)
- Provide benefits of traditional CPU with better domain performance

Network Processing Units
------------------------

- Similar in concept to GPUs but designed for implementing switch backplanes
- Can process many terabits per second of data, far more than we could with a traditional CPU

NPU Benefits
------------

- Very fast SRAM
- Ternary Content Addressable Memory - Packets can be matched at a high rate of speed
- Forwarding is implemented in a paralell pipeline on an ASIC
