Elementary Data Link Protocols
==============================

Ideal channel
-------------

- No errors
- No processing limitations
- Channel always open

Handling limited processing
---------------------------

Stop-and-wait waits for a frame to be acknowledged before sending another.

Handling Loss
-------------

- Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)
- AKA Positive Acknowledgement with Retransmission (PAR)
- Requires adding sequence numbers to header in case ACK is lost

Sliding Window Protocols
========================

Piggybacking
------------

Temporarily delay acks until we have a packet to send
