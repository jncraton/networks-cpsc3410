Global Addresses
================

Flat Addresses
--------------

- We need a unique global identifier
- MAC addresses are unique, but they are also *flat* meaning they can't easily be mapped to a hierarchical network structure.

Hierarchical Addresses
----------------------

- IP addresses are hierarchical
- The parts of the address correspond to a network, then to a host on that network

---

Datagram Forwarding
===================

Assumptions
-----------

- Every Datagram contains a destinaton address
- The network portion of the IP address identifies a single network
- All hosts within a network can communicate directly
- Every network has a router that can exchange packets with other networks

Forwarding
----------

- Determine if we are on the same network as the destination address by comparing to addresses on own interfaces
- If on same network, deliver directly
- If not on same network, forward packet to appropriate router

Forwarding Table
----------------

- Forwarding table will list possible routers
- (NetworkNum, NextHop) pairs
- Individual hosts will often have only a single default router

Forwarding Table Example
------------------------

```
route -n
```

Route Example
-------------

```
traceroute -n 1.1.1.1
```

Subnetting and Classless Addressing
===================================

---

![IPv4 Address classes](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-19-9780123850591.png)

Class Limitations
-----------------

- Address space is limited
- Classes inefficiently use address space
- How can we get more granularity?

---

---

![Subnetting Example](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-21-9780123850591.png){height=540px}

Routing
-------

- We need to adjust forwarding tables slightly to use subnetting
- Use (SubnetNumber, SubnetMask, NextHop) tuples

---

+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| SubnetNumber  | SubnetMask      | NextHop     |
+===============+=================+=============+
| 128.96.34.0   | 255.255.255.128 | Interface 0 |
+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| 128.96.34.128 | 255.255.255.128 | Interface 1 |
+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| 128.96.33.0   | 255.255.255.0   | R2          |
+---------------+-----------------+-------------+

Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)
------------------------------------

- Address space usage is still not ideal, particularly for fowarding
- We can combine subnets together into a supernet

---

![CIDR Router Aggregation](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-22-9780123850591.png)

Notation
--------

- 1.1.1/24 (Class C address)
- Equivalent to 255.255.255.0 Subnet

Address Translation (ARP)
=========================

---

How do we know where an IP address is on our local network?

Use IP address as local addresses
---------------------------------

- Limits the size of network addresses
- Can't work with 48 bit Ethernet addresses
- Rarely done in practice

Store Mappings
--------------

- Could be centrally maintained
- Could be maintained automatically

ARP
---

- Maintains addresses table (ARP Cache)
- Cache values are evicted by timeout
- If a needed value is not present in the cache, an ARP broadcast message is used to learn it

---

![ARP Packet Format](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-23-9780123850591.png){height=540px}

Wireshark Example
-----------------

- Use `arp` filter

Host Configuration (DHCP)
=========================

Addresses
---------

- Ethernet networks use pre-configured globally unique addresses
- IP addresses need to be unique and reflect network structure
- IP addresses have a host and network portion, so addresses can't be preconfigured during device manufacturing
- We need a machanism to assign addresses

Default Gateway
---------------

- Before a host can send a packet outside of the network, it needs to know the local address of the router to send through

Manual Configuration
--------------------

- It is possible to manaully configure addresses, routes and other information
- In real networks manual configuration is typically reserved for servers that need to be connected on a given address even in the face of other network issues
- Manual configuration is too complex for large, dynamic networks

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
------------------------------------------

- Provide a way to automatically assign addresses and other information to hosts
- A DHCP on a network provides this service

Discovery
---------

- We don't have any information when we connect to the network, so we first need to locate a suitable DHCP server
- We broadcast a `DHCP discover` message
- A DHCP Server response with an offer, or a relay responds with the correct server IP

---

![DHCP Relay Example](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-24-9780123850591.png)

---

DHCP Packet
-----------

- Host sends own network address as `chaddr` field
- Server responds with `yiaddr` filled with your IP address
- `option` may be used for other details, such as default gateway

---

![DHCP Packet Format](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-25-9780123850591.png){height=540px}

Wireshark Example
-----------------

- Use `bootp` filter

Error Reporting (ICMP)
======================

Internet Control Message Protocol
---------------------------------

- Acts as a sidechannel for communicate the status of messages

ICMP Uses
---------

- Communicates errors (host unreachable, checksum error, etc)
- ICMP echo requests (ping) can be used to check if a host is up
- ICMP redirect to learn better routes
- Provides building blocks for traceroute

Virtual Networks and Tunnels
============================

Private Networks
----------------

- Corporations with multiple locations like wish to connect their networks
- This can be done over the Internet
- It can be done more securely by leasing private connections between the networks

Virtual Private Networks
------------------------

- It can be more cost-effective to encrypt traffic between networks rather than lease a dedicated connection

---

![a - private network, b - VPN](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-26-9780123850591.png){height=540px}

Tunnels
-------

- We can send IP traffic or other network traffic over another IP connection
- This can be used to encrypt connections or provide access to other systems

SSH Tunnel Example
------------------

Forward remote port 10001 to local port 8000:

```
ssh -R 10001:localhost:8000 user@host
```

3.4 Routing
===========

Getting Routing Information
---------------------------

- Routers need to know where to send packets
- Ethernet switches use a simple forwarding table to map address to ports
- How do routers populate their routing tables?

Routing vs Forwarding
---------------------

- Forwarding is the process of taking a packet and sending it out on another port (*data plane*)
- Routing is the process of determining what values fall in forwarding tables (*control plane*)

Example Routing Table
---------------------

+---------------+---------------+
| Prefix/Length | Next Hop      |
+===============+===============+
| 18/8          | 171.69.245.10 |
+---------------+---------------+

Example Forwarding Table
------------------------

+---------------+-----------+-----------------+
| Prefix/Length | Interface | MAC Address     |
+===============+===========+=================+
| 18/8          | if0       | 8:0:2b:e4:b:1:2 |
+---------------+-----------+-----------------+

Networks as Graphs
------------------

- Hosts on the network are nodes
- Edges represent connections
- Edge weights represent link quality (bandwidth, latency, etc)

---

![Example Network Graph](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-28-9780123850591.png)

Shortest Path
-------------

- The problem of routing requires finding the shortest path between nodes
- Where weighted graphs are used, we are trying to minimize the sum of edge weights along the path

Static Routing
--------------

- For simple networks, we can manually configure routes
- Being static, this mechanism fails to adapt to change

Static Routing Issues
---------------------

- Doesn't adapt to link failures
- Doesn't handle adding new nodes
- Doesn't handle edge weights changing

Routing Protocols
-----------------

- We need a way to dynamically update routing tables
- Handle new hosts
- Handle link changes

Distance-Vector Routing
-----------------------

- Also known as Bellman-Ford
- Each node tracks distance to all nodes
- Nodes distribute knowledge to peers
- Nodes must know distance to their neighbors

---

+-------------+------+---------+

Convergence
-----------

- Routers share their routes with their peers
- Routers use this information to update their routing tables
- All routers end up with complete information

Updates
-------

- Periodic - Sent regularly to connected routers. Indicate that a host is functioning normally
- Triggered - Sent when a router notices a change (link down, etc)

Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
----------------------------------

- Implementation of distance-vector routing in early networks

Link State (OSPF)
-----------------

- Shares entire connection graph with each node
- Nodes calculate shortest path
- Requires reliable information flooding

Reliable Flooding
-----------------

- Mechanism to get all link information to all hosts
- Nodes create Link-state Packet and send them to peers

Link State Packet (LSP)
-----------------------

- The ID of the node that created the LSP
- A list of directly connected neighbors of that node, with the cost of the link to each one
- A sequence number
- A time to live for this packet

Transmission
------------

- LSP packets are sent to peers
- Acknowledgments and retransmissions are used to ensure reliable delivery

Flooding
--------

- Check sequence and node of incoming LSP. Store and transmit to peers if newer than our stored LSP.
- Skip sending updates to the node that sent them to us
- Drop packets after TTL expires

---

![Flooding Example](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-32-9780123850591.png)

Route Calculation
-----------------

- Find shortest path using Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE)

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
-------------------------------

- Link state protocol used by modern networks

Features
--------

- Authentication - to ensure that bad routing information is not injected maliciously
- Additional hierarchy - break domains into areas to reduce total information transferred
- Load balancing - routes with equal weights will all be used evenly

---

![OSPF Header Format](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-34-9780123850591.png)

Routing Metrics
---------------

How do we decide route weights?

ARPANET
-------

- Used queue length as weights
- Provides some useful information, but doesn't work well in practice
- Traffic may get routed around a useful link because that link is useful

ARPANET v2
----------

- Used latency (queue length) and bandwidth
- This allows for a delay calculation for each link
- `Delay = (DepartTime - ArrivalTime) + TransmissionTime + Latency`
- Worked better, but caused high-traffic links to flap between low and high cost

Adjustments
-----------

- Reduce max cost
- Use link utilization in metric
- Smooth link cost changes

---

![ARPANET Routing Metrics](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-36-9780123850591.png)

---


- A highly loaded link never shows a cost of more than three times its cost when idle
- The most expensive link is only seven times the cost of the least expensive
- A high-speed satellite link is more attractive than a low-speed terrestrial link
- Cost is a function of link utilization only at moderate to high loads

Static Costs
------------

- Modern networks have more consistent bandwidth and latency than ARPANET
- Metrics are often set statically by administrators to something such as `C/link_bandwidth`

3.5 Implementation
==================

Software Switch
---------------

- We can create a switch by adding multiple NICs to a general-purpose computer
- All packets must pass through main memory (max bandwidth ~100Gbps)
- Packets must all be processed by a single CPU

---

![Software Switch](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide14.png)

Hardware Switch
---------------

- Software switches have limited bandwidth
- We can improve the situation by creating dedicated parallel hardware

Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
------------------------------------------------

- Custom silicon
- Can be very fast for a particular purpose
- Expensive to produce
- Time consuming to design

Domain Specific Processors
--------------------------

- Can be an option in network hardware
- Add instructions and hardware for particular domain tasks (e.g. machine learning, video encoding)
- Provide benefits of traditional CPU with better domain performance

---

![Switch architecture](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide22.png)

Network Processing Units
------------------------

- Similar in concept to GPUs but designed for implementing switch backplanes
- Can process many terabits per second of data, far more than we could with a traditional CPU

NPU Benefits
------------

- Very fast SRAM
- Ternary Content Addressable Memory - Packets can be matched at a high rate of speed
- Forwarding is implemented in a parallel pipeline on an ASIC
