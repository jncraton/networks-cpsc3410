Why might we want a network of computers?
-----------------------------------------

Course direction
----------------

- Low-level (RF, wires, etc)
- High-level (HTTPS, JSON, etc)

Presentations
-------------

- You will each do two
- The first will cover a low-level topic of interest to you
- The second will cover a high-level topic of interest to you
- Presentations will take place at the beginning of class on assigned days
