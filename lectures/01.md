Introductions
-------------

- Name
- Favorite toy as a child
- What experience do you have with computer networks?

Delta Variant
-------------

- More transmissible
- Appears to be more likely to lead to hospitalization
- Severe symptoms are still largely mitigated by vaccines

Response
--------

- Masks are currently required indoors
- Do not attend class if you have COVID symptoms
- Classroom social distancing is no longer mandated

Contact Tracing
---------------

> Quarantine if you have been in close contact (within 6 feet of someone for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period) with someone who has COVID-19, **unless you have been fully vaccinated**.
> 
> \- CDC

Seating Charts
--------------

- Faculty have been asked to maintain seating charts and attendance records for contact tracing purposes
- Select a seat and keep it for the semester
- Try to sit at least 6 feet from other students if possible, especially if you are not vaccinated

Vaccines
--------

- Safe
- Effective
- Free at health center

Quizzes
-------

- Given regularly at beginning and end of class
- 2 minute time limit
- Should be relatively easy for you
- Allow me to confirm that everyone is keeping up with course material

What is a network?
------------------

(generally, not specific to computers)

A Network
---------

- A graph
- Nodes represent elements of the network
- Edges represent connections between them

Examples of networks
--------------------

Course direction
----------------

- Low-level (RF, wires, etc)
- High-level (HTTPS, JSON, etc)

Presentations
-------------

- You will each do two
- The first will cover a low-level topic of interest to you
- The second will cover a high-level topic of interest to you
- Presentations will take place at the beginning of class on assigned days

Deep Space Network
------------------

![Voyager](https://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/assets/images/about/about_imgrr.jpg)

Functions
---------

- Telemetry
- Command
- Tracking
- Radio science
- Radar mapping

Complexes
---------

> Each of the three Deep Space Network, or DSN, sites has multiple large antennas and is designed to enable continuous radio communication between several spacecraft and Earth. 

Complexes
---------

> All three complexes consist of at least four antenna stations, each equipped with large, parabolic dish antennas and ultra-sensitive receiving systems capable of detecting incredibly faint radio signals from distant spacecraft.

Locations
---------

- Australia (near Canberra)
- Spain (near Madrid)
- United States (California)

Antennas
--------

- Each complex has a 70-meter antenna and several smaller antennas
- The large antenna weighs 2,970 tons.
