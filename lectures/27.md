5.2 Reliable Byte Stream (TCP)
==============================

UDP
---

- Provides very simple demultiplexing to processes on a system
- Implemented as a thin wrapper over IP packets

Missing Features in UDP
-----------------------

- Reliability
- In-order delivery
- Congestion control

Sliding Window Protocol
-----------------------

- Discussed at the link layer
- Similar to ARQ
- Allows multiple packets (window) to be in flight at once

Sliding Window in TCP
---------------------

- Requires connection establishment process, as we aren't dealing with a simple pair of devices
- RTT will vary greatly and be unknown initially
- Reordering must be accounted for
- Hosts may support different (and smaller than ideal) window sizes
- Congestion

TCP Flags
---------

- SYN - Used for connection establishment
- FIN - Used for connection teardown
- RESET - Used for error handling to reset connection
- ACK - Set to indicate that the Acknowledgement field is valid

Establishing a Connection
-------------------------

- Passive open - One party begins listening for connections
- Active open - A second party sends message to initiate a connection
- Messages are exchanges to confirm connection and set parameters

Should sequence numbers start at zero?

Reuse
-----

- Connections between a pair of hosts may be torn down and remade frequently
- To avoid confusing packets from different incarnations of the same connection, we start each from a new number

Buffering Data
--------------

- The sender needs to buffer data until it has been acknowledged
- The receiver needs to buffer out of order data

---

Flow Control
------------

- Hosts advertise an appropriate max windows size using `AdvertisedWindow` in each segment
- Senders respect this size in order to prevent overflowing a receiver

Sequence number wrapping
------------------------

- We need enough space in our sequence number to prevent reuse
- The original 32-bit number is too small for many modern networks, so also consider the 32-bit timestamp field

Triggering Transmission
-----------------------

How do we decide when to transmit a segment from our buffer?

Silly Window Syndrome
---------------------

- Sending only segments using MSS requires waiting for a full MSS before sending
- If we send segments smaller than MSS, a segment of that size will continue to be used

Nagle's Algorithm
-----------------

- If we have available data and a sufficient window to send a full segment, we do so
- If we have no data in flight, we send any data we have immediately
- Otherwise, we wait until no data is in flight or we have a complete segment to send
