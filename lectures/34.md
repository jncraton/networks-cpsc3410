Encryption
==========

Transport Layer Security
------------------------

- Provides an encrypted connection much like a TCP socket
- Keys are created during handshake
- Identity of server is verify using public key cryptography (certificate)

QUIC and HTTP/3
---------------

- TLS and TCP both require handshakes
- These can be combined to reduce latency
- QUIC was proposed in 2012 to address this and has now been adopted as part of HTTP/3

QUIC Performance
----------------

- Can improve latency by 10-30%
