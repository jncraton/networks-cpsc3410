Flooding
========

---

Send every incoming pack out on every other link

Infinite packets
----------------

- Routing loops will cause unlimited packets to be created
- Can be addressed with a hop count or time-to-live (TTL)
- Still produces exponentially many duplicate packets

Flooding Advantages
-------------------

- Simple
- Extremely robust to network issues

Distance Vector Routing (Bellman-Ford)
======================================

---

- Routers maintain a list of the best next hop to arrive at a destination
- Tables are updated by communication between routers

Link State Routing
==================

---

Replaced Distance Vector Routing in 1979 on ARPANET

---

Process
-------

1. Routers discover neighbors and learn addresses
2. Set cost metric for neighbors
3. Construct a packet containing this knowledge
4. Send the packet to all other routers
5. Compute the shortest path for every other router
