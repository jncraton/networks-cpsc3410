Sockets
=======

---

Sockets provide a standard interface from the network to our applications

Socket types
------------

- Stream - provides a virtual circuit
- Datagram - delivers individual packets

Socket Implementation
---------------------

- Independent of network type
- Most typically used with TCP/IP and UDP/IP

---

UDP Sockets in Python
---------------------

Create a socket
---------------

```python
sock = socket.socket(family=AF_INET, type=SOCK_DGRAM)
```

Send Data
---------

- Send raw bytes to a port on a particular IP

```python
sock.sendto(b"Hello!", ("127.0.0.1", 2001))
```

Get Data
--------

- Returns bytes from socket when available

```python
data, address = sock.recvfrom(1024)
```

---

Close a socket

```python
sock.close()
```

Bind
----

- Used when implementing a server
- Tells the OS to direct incoming UDP packets to your process

```python
sock.bind(("127.0.0.1", 2001))
```

Math Server Example
-------------------

```python
import socket

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

sock.bind(("127.0.0.1", 9999))

while True:
    data, address = sock.recvfrom(1024)

    value = int.from_bytes(data, "little")
    square = value ** 2

    sock.sendto(square.to_bytes(4, "little"), address)
```

QUIC
====

Saving Round Trips
------------------

- The layered nature of our stack can cause inefficiency
- TCP requires a handshake to establish a connection
- If we desire encryption, we need a second handshake to establish that

QUIC
----

- Combines establishing a connection and establishing encryption into one handshake
- Can save one RTT of latency when creating connections
- HTTP/3 uses QUIC for transport

Connection Identifiers in QUIC
------------------------------

- TCP connections are defined by their address and port tuple
- QUIC connections are defined by a 64-bit ID generated by the client
- Using a separate ID greatly simplifies the process of migrating connections from one network to another

5.3 Remote Procedure Call
=========================

Request/Reply
-------------

- A Simple paradigm for interacting with a server is to make a request and *block* while waiting for a reply.

RPC Challenges
--------------

- IP is unreliable
- Packets may be reordered
- Message may not fit in single packets

RPC Requirements
----------------

1. Reliable communication protocol
2. A mechanism to convert data and instructions to a shared format (stub compiler)

---

RPC Identifiers
---------------

- Provide a name space for uniquely identifying the procedure to be called
- Match each reply message to the corresponding request message

Overcoming Network Limitations
------------------------------

- Reliability (we can use TCP, but it may be more expensive)
- Support for large messages

---

Implicit ACK
------------

- In some cases we may be able to skip sending explicit ACKs
- We can use replys and requests as implicit ACKs
