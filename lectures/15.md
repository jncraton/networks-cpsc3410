3.1 Switching Basics
====================

Direct Connections
------------------

- We have assumed up until now that our devices are directly connected
- Ethernet bus
- Wifi radios

Direct Connection Limits
------------------------

- Cable length
- Radio range
- Collision domain size

Internetworking
---------------

- We connect our networks together in order to form the global Internet

Routers
-------

- Operate at layer 3 and may connect networks of different types

Switches
--------

- Operate at layer 2 and connect networks of the same type
- May also be called bridges

Switches
--------

- Multiple-input, multiple-output device
- Transfers packets from an input to one or more output ports

Switch Benefits
---------------

- Can be interconnect to form networks of many hosts
- Can be connected via point-to-point links like fiber to create a geographically large network
- New hosts do not decrease the performance of other hosts

Star Topology
-------------

- Classic Ethernet uses physical bus topology
- This has many weaknesses, including a large collision domain
- Switches allow a star topology which avoids this problem

Classic vs Switched Ethernet
----------------------------

- Classic - Hosts limited to the speed of the medium (10mbps) collectively
- Switched - Hosts limited to the speed of the medium individually
- Switching is far more scalable
