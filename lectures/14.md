2.8 Access Networks
===================

Passive Optical Network
=======================

--- 

- Used to provide broadband access to homes and businesses.
- Uses passive splitters to separate fibers

Components
----------

- Optical Line Terminal (OLT) - terminates fiber at ISP
- Optical Network Unit (ONU) - terminates fiber at endpoints

Downstream Access
-----------------

- ONUs receive every frame from the OLT
- ONUs use addressing to identify their frames
- Encryption is used to protect traffic

Upstream Access
---------------

- ONUs are sent grants from the OLT indicatin when they can transmit
- OLT manages grants as a way of maintaining fairness and usage of the link

Cellular Networks
=================

Compared to 802.11
------------------

- Transmits data via radio frequency
- Uses licensed bands vs unlicensed ISM band for 802.11
- Only certain devices are allowed to use frequencies

Frequencies
-----------

- Vary based on region
- Allocated by government
- Typically 700MHz to 2400MHz
- Some higher frequencies are seeing more use

Frequency considerations
------------------------

- Lower frequencies can better pass through obstructions
- Wider frequency bands can transmit more data
- This creates competition for freqencies from ~700 to ~2400 MHz

Cellular Network Hardware
-------------------------

- User Equipment (UE) - Phones and other devices connected to the network
- Broadband Base Units (BBU) - Similar to 802.11 APs
- Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - Provides backbone for BBUs
- Radio Access Network (RAN) - Collection of BBUs

Cells
-----

- Area served by a BBU antenna
- May be one cell per BBU
- Multiple cells could be served by a BBU using directional antennas

Overlap
-------

- Cells overlap somewhat
- When the network detects that a device is moving from one cell to another, a handoff occurs
- Cells are designed intentionally to not use the same frequency on adjacent cells

This is a NP-complete graph coloring problem.

Medium Access
-------------

- 802.11 is contention based
- Most cellular networks are reservation based

Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
-----------------------------------------------------

- Uses a number of independent (orthogonal) frequency bands to transmit
- Individual time slices on a band, resource units (REs), are assigned by the scheduler
- Scheduler operates on units of bands and time called Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs)

5G
---

- Add additional frequency bands and more complex scheduling
- Improves throughput
