Access Protocol
===============

---

We can hear all data as it is broadcast on the network, but we need to identify the data that matters to us.

Ethernet Frame
--------------

- 64 bit preamble to allow synchronization
- 6 byte source MAC address
- 6 byte destination MAC address
- 2 byte type field
- Payload
- 4 byte CRC

---

![Ethernet frame](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-25-9780123850591.png)

Addresses
---------

- Assigned to an adapter at manufacture time
- Do not need to allocated by some system on the network like IP addresses

Frames passed up by receiver 
----------------------------

- Frames addressed to its own address
- Frames addressed to the broadcast address
- Frames addressed to a multicast address, if it has been instructed to listen to that address
- All frames, if it has been placed in promiscuous mode

Transmitter Algorithm
---------------------

- If line is idle, and we have data to send, send it
- When we have a frame to send and the line is busy, we wait to transmit until the line is idle and send immediately

---

Collisions
----------

- If we detect a collision, we send a jamming signal so others detect the collision and try again after some delay.
- If we experience multiple collisions, our delay increases by some factor (*exponential backoff*)

Why Ethernet?
=============

Ethernet has been dominant for around 40 years
----------------------------------------------

- Components (copper, fiber, NICs) are cheap
- Complex switching hardware is not required
- Backwards compatibility while adding improvements
- Administration is simple (no addresses to manage, etc)

2.7 Wireless Networks
=====================

Wireless Differences
--------------------

- In most cases, links are broadcast
- Collisions are very likely
- Sources of errors are abundant

+-------------+-----------------------+-----------------+--------------+

Frequency Use
-------------

- RF collisions between all sorts of devices are possible
- Governments typically slice up the spectrum and allocate it for various purposes
- In the US, the FCC handles these allocations

Frequency Licenses
------------------

- Many frequency bands require an explicit license
- Even unlicensed bands require rules to be followed to limit interference, such as a maximum legal transmission frequency

Base Stations
-------------

In most network designs, we have a device generically referred to as a base station that has a high-bandwidth link to the network and wirelessly serves other clients.

Mesh networks
-------------

- Lack a central base station
- Wireless communication between all nodes

---

802.11
======

Wifi
----

- Commonly use to cover small geographic area (homes, offices, etc)
- Can be operated without a license

Main standards
--------------

- 802.11b - 11mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz
- 802.11a - 54mbps max data rate, 5GHz
- 802.11g - 54mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz
- 802.11n - 150mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz (40MHz channel, no MIMO)
- 802.11ac - 867mbps 2.4Ghz and 5GHz (8 antenna AP, 160MHz channel)

Bitrate negotiation
-------------------

- Bitrates can be adjusted in response to surrounding noise and interference

Improvements over time
----------------------

- Improved hardware and encoding/decoding techniques
- Channel bonding
- MIMO

MIMO
----

- Multiple input, multiple output
- Uses arrays of antennas and interference patterns to create multiple spatial streams

---

[Beamlab](https://apenwarr.ca/beamlab/)

Real speed increases
--------------------

- Many increases in performance are hard to realize
- Some require uncongested areas
- Some require signal quality that is difficult to realize in reality in order to negotiate the highest rates

Collisions
---------

How do we make ourself heard while avoiding talking over others?

Collision detection
-------------------

- In Ethernet we can listen to our bus to know if it is in use
- We can't do this perfectly when communicating with a wireless base station

---

---

![Exposed node problem](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-31-9780123850591.png){height=540px}

Collision Avoidance
-------------------

We need a mechanism to prevent collisions the we can't observe ourselves

Request to send
---------------

- When we have data to send, we send and RTS packet to the base station including the amount of time that we need
- The base station responds with a CTS packet letting us know we can proceed
- Network Allocation Vector (NAV) - Hosts on the network track time until it is available by observing RTS and CTS frames

RTS Collisions
--------------

- RTS frames may collide
- This is identified by lack of CTS
- Backoff then occurs before retry

Distribution System
===================

Base stations
-------------

- 802.11 can be used for ad-hoc networks, but it usually involves one or more base stations or APs
- In networks with multiple APs, APs are networked together via a distribution system

---

![Distribution System](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-32-9780123850591.png)

Joining a network
-----------------

1. Node sends `Probe` frame
2. APs respond with `Probe Response` frame
3. Node selects AP and sends `Association Request` frame
4. The AP replies with an `Association Response` frame

Mobility
--------

- Nodes may choose to drop their associated AP and associate with a new one
- This process is the same as the initial process to join the network

---

![Node Mobility](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-33-9780123850591.png)

Passive scanning
----------------

- `Probe` frames are used for active scanning
- We can also passively listen for `Beacon` frames sent at regular intervals by the AP

Frame Format
============

---

![802.11 frame](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-34-9780123850591.png)

Multiple Addresses
------------------

- We need additional addresses in the frame to handle cases where we are sending
- Transmitter Address (TA)
- Receiver Address (RA)
- Source Address (SA)
- Destination Address (DA)

---

![Wifi Addresses](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-34-9780123850591.png)

Wifi Security
-------------

- All traffic is broadcast over the air and is vulnerable to eavesdropping
- We will discuss adding encryption to secure wireless channels in chapter 8

Bluetooth
=========

---

- Operates at 2.45 GHz
- Connect devices at short range
- Headsets, mice, etc


2.8 Access Networks
===================

Passive Optical Network
=======================

--- 

- Used to provide broadband access to homes and businesses.
- Uses passive splitters to separate fibers

---

![PON network fanout](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide12.png)

Components
----------

- Optical Line Terminal (OLT) - terminates fiber at ISP
- Optical Network Unit (ONU) - terminates fiber at endpoints

Downstream Access
-----------------

- ONUs receive every frame from the OLT
- ONUs use addressing to identify their frames
- Encryption is used to protect traffic

Upstream Access
---------------

- ONUs are sent grants from the OLT indicatin when they can transmit
- OLT manages grants as a way of maintaining fairness and usage of the link

Cellular Networks
=================

Compared to 802.11
------------------

- Transmits data via radio frequency
- Uses licensed bands vs unlicensed ISM band for 802.11
- Only certain devices are allowed to use frequencies

Frequencies
-----------

- Vary based on region
- Allocated by government
- Typically 700MHz to 2400MHz
- Some higher frequencies are seeing more use

Frequency considerations
------------------------

- Lower frequencies can better pass through obstructions
- Wider frequency bands can transmit more data
- This creates competition for freqencies from ~700 to ~2400 MHz

---

![EM Spectrum](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Electromagnetic-Spectrum.svg/316px-Electromagnetic-Spectrum.svg.png)

Cellular Network Hardware
-------------------------

- User Equipment (UE) - Phones and other devices connected to the network
- Broadband Base Units (BBU) - Similar to 802.11 APs
- Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - Provides backbone for BBUs
- Radio Access Network (RAN) - Collection of BBUs

---

![Cellular Network](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide2.png)

---

Cells
-----

- Area served by a BBU antenna
- May be one cell per BBU
- Multiple cells could be served by a BBU using directional antennas

Overlap
-------

- Cells overlap somewhat
- When the network detects that a device is moving from one cell to another, a handoff occurs
- Cells are designed intentionally to not use the same frequency on adjacent cells

---

![Frequency Reuse](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Frequency_reuse.svg/595px-Frequency_reuse.svg.png)

---

![Frequency Reuse with Directional Antennas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/CellTowersAtCorners.gif)

---

This is a NP-complete graph coloring problem.

Medium Access
-------------

- 802.11 is contention based
- Most cellular networks are reservation based

Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
-----------------------------------------------------

- Uses a number of independent (orthogonal) frequency bands to transmit
- Individual time slices on a band, resource units (REs), are assigned by the scheduler
- Scheduler operates on units of bands and time called Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs)

---

![PRBs and REs](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide4.png)

5G
---

- Add additional frequency bands and more complex scheduling
- Improves throughput
