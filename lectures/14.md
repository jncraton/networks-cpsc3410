Components
----------

- Optical Line Terminal (OLT) - terminates fiber at ISP
- Optical Network Unit (ONU) - terminates fiber at endpoints

Downstream Access
-----------------

- ONUs receive every frame from the OLT
- ONUs use addressing to identify their frames
- Encryption is used to protect traffic

Upstream Access
---------------

- ONUs are sent grants from the OLT indicatin when they can transmit
- OLT manages grants as a way of maintaining fairness and usage of the link
