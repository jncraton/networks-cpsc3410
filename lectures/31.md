6.3 TCP Congestion Control
==========================

Overview
--------

- CongestionWindow is managed by sender to limit packets in flight and transmission speed

Congestion Window
-----------------

- Set based on perceived network congestion
- Packet timeouts are used to adjust window size
- Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease

Window Adjustment
-----------------

- Halve window size on each timeout
- Add 1 to window size on each successful round trip
- In practice, window size is increased by a small fraction of MSS for each ACK

Slow Start
----------

- TCP originally sent as many packets as the advertised window would allow when starting connections
- This caused congestion issues, and the behavior was changed to double the congestion window on each ACK at the start of a connection
- Slow start is also used when the connection is dead after waiting for a timeout

Fast Retransmit
---------------

- Oridinarily, we wait for a coarse-grained timeout before sending a packet
- We can implement an algorithm that performs more effectively by using knowledge of our link
- By listening for duplicate ACKs, we can deduce lost packets and retransmit them

TCP CUBIC
---------

- Alternative congestion window management algorithm
- Default algorithm used by Linux

Max Window Size
---------------

- TCP CUBIC tracks the largest congestion window it was able to use successfully before experiencing congestion
- After a congestion event, CUBIC attempts to return to this window size at a cubic rate
- It approaches slowly, plateaus for, and then attempts to probe for a larger max window
