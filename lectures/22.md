3.4 Routing
===========

Getting Routing Information
---------------------------

- Routers need to know where to send packets
- Ethernet switches use a simple forwarding table to map address to ports
- How do routers populate their routing tables?

Routing vs Forwarding
---------------------

- Forwarding is the process of taking a packet and sending it out on another port (*data plane*)
- Routing is the process of determining what values fall in forwarding tables (*control plane*)

Example Routing Table
---------------------

+---------------+---------------+
| Prefix/Length | Next Hop      |
+===============+===============+
| 18/8          | 171.69.245.10 |
+---------------+---------------+

Example Forwarding Table
------------------------

+---------------+-----------+-----------------+
| Prefix/Length | Interface | MAC Address     |
+===============+===========+=================+
| 18/8          | if0       | 8:0:2b:e4:b:1:2 |
+---------------+-----------+-----------------+

Networks as Graphs
------------------

- Hosts on the network are nodes
- Edges represent connections
- Edge weights represent link quality (bandwidth, latency, etc)

Shortest Path
-------------

- The problem of routing requires finding the shortest path between nodes
- Where weighted graphs are used, we are trying to minimize the sum of edge weights along the path

Static Routing
--------------

- For simple networks, we can manually configure routes
- Being static, this mechanism fails to adapt to change

Static Routing Issues
---------------------

- Doesn't adapt to link failures
- Doesn't handle adding new nodes
- Doesn't handle edge weights changing

Routing Protocols
-----------------

- We need a way to dynamically update routing tables
- Handle new hosts
- Handle link changes

Distance-Vector Routing
-----------------------

- Also known as Bellman-Ford
- Each node tracks distance to all nodes
- Nodes distribute knowledge to peers
- Nodes must know distance to their neighbors

+-------------+------+---------+

Convergence
-----------

- Routers share their routes with their peers
- Routers use this information to update their routing tables
- All routers end up with complete information

Updates
-------

- Periodic - Sent regularly to connected routers. Indicate that a host is functioning normally
- Triggered - Sent when a router notices a change (link down, etc)

Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
----------------------------------

- Implementation of distance-vector routing in early networks

Link State (OSPF)
-----------------

- Shares entire connection graph with each node
- Nodes calculate shortest path
- Requires reliable information flooding

Reliable Flooding
-----------------

- Mechanism to get all link information to all hosts
- Nodes create Link-state Packet and send them to peers

Link State Packet (LSP)
-----------------------

- The ID of the node that created the LSP
- A list of directly connected neighbors of that node, with the cost of the link to each one
- A sequence number
- A time to live for this packet

Transmission
------------

- LSP packets are sent to peers
- Acknowledgments and retransmissions are used to ensure reliable delivery

Flooding
--------

- Check sequence and node of incoming LSP. Store and transmit to peers if newer than our stored LSP.
- Skip sending updates to the node that sent them to us
- Drop packets after TTL expires

Route Calculation
-----------------

- Find shortest path using Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE)

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
-------------------------------

- Link state protocol used by modern networks

Features
--------

- Authentication - to ensure that bad routing information is not injected maliciously
- Additional hierarchy - break domains into areas to reduce total information transferred
- Load balancing - routes with equal weights will all be used evenly

Routing Metrics
---------------

How do we decide route weights?

ARPANET
-------

- Used queue length as weights
- Provides some useful information, but doesn't work well in practice
- Traffic may get routed around a useful link because that link is useful

ARPANET v2
----------

- Used latency (queue length) and bandwidth
- This allows for a delay calculation for each link
- `Delay = (DepartTime - ArrivalTime) + TransmissionTime + Latency`
- Worked better, but caused high-traffic links to flap between low and high cost

Adjustments
-----------

- Reduce max cost
- Use link utilization in metric
- Smooth link cost changes

---

![ARPANET Routing Metrics](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-36-9780123850591.png)

---


- A highly loaded link never shows a cost of more than three times its cost when idle
- The most expensive link is only seven times the cost of the least expensive
- A high-speed satellite link is more attractive than a low-speed terrestrial link
- Cost is a function of link utilization only at moderate to high loads

Static Costs
------------

- Modern networks have more consistent bandwidth and latency than ARPANET
- Metrics are often set statically by administrators to something such as `C/link_bandwidth`
