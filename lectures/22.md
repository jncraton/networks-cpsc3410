Example Protocols
=================

PPP
---

Point-to-point Protocol

Features
--------

- Framing method delineating start and end with error detection
- Link Control Protocol (LCP) to handle bringing up links and managing parameters
- Network-layer option negotiation via NCP

Overview
--------

- Byte oriented protocol
- Byte stuffing and flag bytes used for frame detection
- Sliding window, acknowledgements, and timeouts for flow control

Medium Access Control Sublayer
==============================

---

How do we decide who gets to talk on a shared broadcast medium?

Static Allocation
-----------------

Each hosts get allocated a piece of the layer to use (FDM, TDM, etc)

Weaknesses
----------

- Very poor performance with bursty traffic (most traffic is bursty)

Dynamic Channel Allocation
--------------------------

Use real-time algorithms to allocate channel access

Assumptions
-----------

1. Independent Traffic
2. Single Channel
3. Observable Collisions
4. Continuous or slotted time
5. Carrier sense or no carrier sense

Independent traffic
-------------------

- The most questionable assumption
- It is usually incorrect, but makes networks much simpler to reason about

ALOHA
=====

- If you have data to send, send it
- A central hub relays your transmission to all hosts
- You listen for the retransmission to ensure that no errors occurred
- If there was an error, try again after a random delay

Slotted ALOHA
-------------

- Similar to ALOHA, but with assigned time slots for frames

Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
====================================

1-persistent CSMA
-----------------

1. If you have data to send, listen for traffic
2. Wait if someone else is transmitting
3. Send your data when channel is quiet

---

Does this solve our collision problem?

---

What happens when 2 hosts have data ready to send while a third host is transmitting?

Non-persistent CSMA
-------------------

Introduce a random delay if we are waiting on the line to be free

P-persistent CSMA
-----------------

- Slotted protocol
- Transmit with probability P when line is available and we have data to send
