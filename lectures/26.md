Service Goals
-------------

- Router technology independence
- Transport layer should not need to care about router count, technology, or topology
- Network addresses should be consistent accross LANs and WANs

Connection-Oriented Networks
----------------------------

- Connections
- Reliable delivery

Virtual Circuit
---------------

Connectionless Networks
-----------------------


End-to-end principle - Connections and reliable delivery are left of to the hosts at the end, and not the network hardware.
