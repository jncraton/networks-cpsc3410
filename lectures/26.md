Netork Layer
============

Layers
------

- Application
- Transport
- Network <-- We are here
- Link
- Physical

Service Goals
-------------

- Router technology independence
- Transport layer should not need to care about router count, technology, or topology
- Network addresses should be consistent accross LANs and WANs

Connectionless Networks
-----------------------

End-to-end principle - Connections and reliable delivery are left of to the hosts at the end, and not the network hardware.

Connection-Oriented Networks
----------------------------

- Connections
- Reliable delivery

Routing Algorithms
==================

---

Routing algorithms decide which outgoing line incoming data should be transmitted on

Static Routing
--------------

- Non-adaptive
- Routes are determined when the network is booted

Dynamic Routing
---------------

- Adaptive
- Routes are adjusted based on network conditions

Optimality Principle
--------------------

If router J is on the optimal path from I to K, then the optimal path from J to K is on the same route.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
----------------------------

- Graph with no loops
- Edges have directionality

Shortest Path Algorithms
------------------------

- Number of hops
- Edge values
