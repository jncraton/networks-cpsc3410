Service Goals
-------------

- Router technology independence
- Transport layer should not need to care about router count, technology, or topology
- Network addresses should be consistent accross LANs and WANs

Connectionless Networks
-----------------------

End-to-end principle - Connections and reliable delivery are left of to the hosts at the end, and not the network hardware.
