Support for Common Services
===========================

---

We don't merely want to send packets around, we want to provide service that makes it easy to build applications

Channels
--------

- We think of the network as providing *channels* for individual applications to communicate
- Layering is used to create this channel abstraction on top of packet-switched networks

Channel needs
-------------

- Reliability - Do messages need to arrive?
- Privacy - Can others see our messages?
- Ordering - Do messages need to arrive in the order they were sent?

Big idea
--------

Different applications will have different needs, so we need to design different abstractions that work well for them.

Manageability
=============

---

Networks have to be managed and maintained

Common tasks
------------

- Replacing hardware
- Adding hosts
- Troubleshooting issues

Self-healing designs
--------------------

- Allow humans to be removed from the loop, or at least have a less urgent role

Change management
-----------------

- There is often a tension between *feature velocity* and *stability*
- Any time something is changed, there is a chance that it will cause breakages
