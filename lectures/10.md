![EM Spectrum Examples](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg/800px-EM_Spectrum_Properties_edit.svg.png)

Frequency
---------

- Number of oscillations per second
- Measure in Hertz (Hz)
- Typically variable f

Wavelength
----------

- Length of the wave period
- Distance between consecutive maxima
- Measure in meters
- Typically variable λ

Speed of Light
--------------

- Typically variable c
- 300,000 m/s

Frequencey and Wavelength
-------------------------

$$λ f = c$$

Wide band
---------

- Frequency hopping spread spectrum
- Direct sequence spread spectrum (often using CDMA)
- Ultra Wideband (UWB)

Radio Transmission
------------------

Path Loss
---------

- Signals degrade naturally over distance
- Typical power loss is ${1 \over r^2}$

Impact of frequency on signal strength
--------------------------------------

- Lower frequencies typically travel further
- Lower frequencies are less impacted by blocked line of sight
- Lower frequencies have lower bandwidth

Max channel bandwidth
---------------------

$$\textrm{max data rate} = B \log_2(1 + {S \over N}) \textrm{ bits/sec}$$

Directionality
--------------

- Higher frequencies can be focused into tighter beams
- Microwave signals (100 MHz+) can be transmitted in a beam

Power level decreases with surface area covered

Repeaters
---------

- May be used to boost a signal after some distance
- Must be used in some form to route around Earth's curvature

Frequency allocation
--------------------

- "Beauty contest" - Prone to bribery and corruption
- Lottery - Prone to profiteering
- Auction - Organizations must pay billions

ISM Bands
---------

- Unlicensed
- Power limited by law
- 900 MHz, 2.4Ghz, 5GHz

Infrared Transmission
---------------------

- Used by TV remotes
- Can't pass through any line of sight blocker
- Has been used for computer device communication

Light Transmission
------------------

- Focus and aim narrow lasers at a distant detector
- Blocked by line of sight
- Can be very high bandwidth

Communication Satellites
========================

Basic concept
-------------

- Radio transmission gets blocked by surface interference, so we place repeaters in the sky

Transponder
-----------

- Recieves incoming transmissions and rebroadcasts on another frequency
- Lacks intelligence
- Referred to as a "bent pipe"

Basic orbital mechanics
-----------------------

- Can't escape gravity by going up
- Counter gravity by going sidways ($\Delta v$)
- Higher orbits require higher $\Delta v$
