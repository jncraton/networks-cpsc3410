2.4 Error Detection
===================

Errors
------

- Data errors at the physical level are unavoidable
- Data errors at the software level are unacceptable

Link Types
----------

- Fiber - very low error rate on good links
- Copper - very low error rate, but somewhat worse than fiber
- RF - bit errors and long strings of errors are probable

Handling errors
---------------

1. Detect that an error has occurred
2. Ask for retransmission

Simple error detection
----------------------

- Send message twice
- Confirm that both copies are identical

Simple error detection
----------------------

- 2x overhead
- A 2-bit error could be undetected

Overhead
--------

- We want to be able to add k bits to an n bit message in a way that can detect the most possible errors

Parity
------

- Adds a single bit to a message that makes the total number of 1s odd or even
- Will catch any odd number of bit error (1, 3, etc)
- Will miss any even number of bit errors
- Used in RS232

Checksum
--------

- Error detecting code involving addition

Checksum Process
----------------

- Treat each word in the message as a number
- Add the words and transmit their lowest k-bits as the checksum
- Confirm that the checksum matches when receiving frames
- Catches most errors, but will still miss errors that "cancel out"\

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
-----------------------------

- Provides a division-like check function
- Efficient to implement in hardware
- Can be tuned by selecting different polynomials
- CRC32 is used in Ethernet

CRC as a hash function
----------------------

- CRC is effectively a hash function
- It's not designed as a *cryptographic* hash function
- It's not  designed to prevent intentionals collisions, but simply to detect random errors
- Do not use it as a cryptographic hash function

Error Correction
================

Hamming Codes
-------------

- A mechanism to correct errors in transmission using overlapping parity bits
- Provides relatively simple ECC example
- Used in ECC RAM
