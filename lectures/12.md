2.6 Multi-access networks
=========================

Multi-access
------------

- Hosts share the same link

CSMA/CD
-------

- We need to ensure the channel is quiet before sending (carrier sense)
- We need to stop transmitting if someone else start (collision detection)

History
-------

- Basic algorithm similar to ALOHA
- Used in older Ethernet, but not in modern switched Ethernet
- Used in modern 802.11

ALOHA
-----

- Send data if you have it to send
- Listen to transmission rebroadcast. If it is not your message, you need to resend

Slotted ALOHA
