2.6 Multi-access networks
=========================

Multi-access
------------

- Hosts share the same link

CSMA/CD
-------

- We need to ensure the channel is quiet before sending (carrier sense)
- We need to stop transmitting if someone else start (collision detection)

History
-------

- Basic algorithm similar to ALOHA
- Used in older Ethernet, but not in modern switched Ethernet
- Used in modern 802.11

ALOHA
-----

- Send data if you have it to send
- Listen to transmission rebroadcast. If it is not your message, you need to resend

Slotted ALOHA
-------------

- Introduce time slots for transmission

Physical Properties
===================

![Ethernet Bus](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-22-9780123850591.png)

Bus
---

- All hosts are connected to the same medium
- If hosts use the medium at the same time, collisions will occur
- We need to minimize collisions while maximizing time that the bus is active to maximize throughput


Repeaters
---------

- Forward signals between networks
- Allow larger Ethernet networks
- Can create very large broadcast domain

Broadcast
---------

- All host receive all frames
- Hosts compete for bandwidth

Access Protocol
===============

---

We can hear all data as it is broadcast on the network, but we need to identify the data that matters to us.

Ethernet Frame
--------------

- 64 bit preamble to allow syncronization
- 6 byte source address
- 6 byte destination address
- 2 byte type field
- Payload
- 4 byte CRC

---

Frames passed up by receiver 
----------------------------

- Frames addressed to its own address
- Frames addressed to the broadcast address
- Frames addressed to a multicast address, if it has been instructed to listen to that address
- All frames, if it has been placed in promiscuous mode
