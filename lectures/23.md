4.2 IP Version 6
================

IP Version 4
------------

- Still used by most hosts on the Internet
- Limited to 32-bit addresses (4 billion unique address)

IP Upgrade
----------

- Growing address size requires new version of IP protocol and associated network hardware upgrades
- It made sense to include other new features while updating the protocol

IPv6 Features
-------------

- Autoconfiguration
- Enhanced routing
- Compatibility with IPv4 during transition period

IPv6 Addresses
--------------

- 128 bits long
- Support embedding 48-bit link-local addresses

---

+-----------------+---------------------+
| Prefix          | Use                 |
+=================+=====================+
| 00…0 (128 bits) | Unspecified         |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 00…1 (128 bits) | Loopback            |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1111 1111       | Multicast addresses |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1111 1110 10    | Link-local unicast  |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| Everything else | Global Unicast      |
+-----------------+---------------------+

Notation
--------

- Typically 8 groups of 4 hex characters
- For example: 47CD:1234:4422:ACO2:0022:1234:A456:0124
- Runs of zeroes may be omitted (47CD::A456:0124)
- IPv4 over IPv6 may be written as ::FFFF:128.96.33.81

Global Unicast Addresses
------------------------

- Support hierarchical routing by default
- Leverage extra bits to create cleaner format and networking boundaries

IPv6 Packet Format
------------------

- Updates version field to 6
- Removes rarely used features
- Adds longer addresses
- Improves option parsing via static ordering

Fragmentation
-------------

- We try to avoid fragmentation whenever possible
- We move fragmentation information out of standard headers and into options to save space in the common case

Autoconfiguration
-----------------

- Advanced feature of IPv6
- Allows creating local addresses without DHCP
- We can create link-local addresses using a prefix and MAC address

---

+-----------------+---------------------+
| Prefix          | Use                 |
+=================+=====================+
| 00…0 (128 bits) | Unspecified         |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 00…1 (128 bits) | Loopback            |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1111 1111       | Multicast addresses |
+-----------------+---------------------+
|**1111 1110 10** | Link-local unicast  |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| Everything else | Global Unicast      |
+-----------------+---------------------+

Source-Directed Routing
-----------------------

- Allow individual packets to specify which networks they should pass through
- Can be used to balance cost and quality of service requirements

4.3 Multicast
=============

Multicast
---------

- There are applications, such as live broadcasts, that can benefit from sending traffic to multiple hosts
- Sending a packet to multiple hosts is known as multicasting

Multicast Addresses
-------------------

- There are special address ranges in IPv4 and IPv6 reserved for multicasting
- Hosts can configure there NICs to listen to multicast addresses of interest

Multicast Routing
