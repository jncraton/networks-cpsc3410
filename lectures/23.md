3.4 Routing
===========

Getting Routing Information
---------------------------

- Routers need to know where to send packets
- Ethernet switches use a simple forwarding table to map address to ports
- How do routers populate their routing tables?

Routing vs Forwarding
---------------------

- Forwarding is the process of taking a packet and sending it out on another port (*data plane*)
- Routing is the process of determining what values fall in forwarding tables (*control plane*)

Networks as Graphs
------------------

- Hosts on the network are nodes
- Edges represent connections
- Edge weights represent link quality (bandwidth, latency, etc)

---

Shortest Path
-------------

- The problem of routing requires finding the shortest path between nodes
- Where weighted graphs are used, we are trying to minimize the sum of edge weights along the path

Static Routing
--------------

- For simple networks, we can manually configure routes
- Being static, this mechanism fails to adapt to change

Static Routing Issues
---------------------

- Doesn't adapt to link failures
- Doesn't handle adding new nodes
- Doesn't handle edge weights changing

Routing Protocols
-----------------

- We need a way to dynamically update routing tables
- Handle new hosts
- Handle link changes

Distance-Vector Routing
-----------------------

- Also known as Bellman-Ford
- Each node tracks distance to all nodes
- Nodes distribute knowledge to peers
- Nodes must know distance to their neighbors

+-------------+------+---------+

Convergence
-----------

- Routers share their routes with their peers
- Routers use this information to update their routing tables
- All routers end up with complete information

Updates
-------

- Periodic - Sent regularly to connected routers. Indicate that a host is functioning normally
- Triggered - Sent when a router notices a change (link down, etc)

Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
----------------------------------

- Implementation of distance-vector routing in early networks

Link State (OSPF)
-----------------

- Shares entire connection graph with each node
- Nodes calculate shortest path
- Requires reliable information flooding

Reliable Flooding
-----------------

- Mechanism to get all link information to all hosts
- Nodes create Link-state Packet and send them to peers

Link State Packet (LSP)
-----------------------

- The ID of the node that created the LSP
- A list of directly connected neighbors of that node, with the cost of the link to each one
- A sequence number
- A time to live for this packet

Transmission
------------

- LSP packets are sent to peers
- Acknowledgments and retransmissions are used to ensure reliable delivery

Flooding
--------

- Check sequence and node of incoming LSP. Store and transmit to peers if newer than our stored LSP.
- Skip sending updates to the node that sent them to us
- Drop packets after TTL expires

---

Route Calculation
-----------------

- Find shortest path using Dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazC3A4OQTE)

Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
-------------------------------

- Link state protocol used by modern networks

Features
--------

- Authentication - to ensure that bad routing information is not injected maliciously
- Additional hierarchy - break domains into areas to reduce total information transferred
- Load balancing - routes with equal weights will all be used evenly

---

Routing Metrics
---------------

How do we decide route weights?

ARPANET
-------

- Used queue length as weights
- Provides some useful information, but doesn't work well in practice
- Traffic may get routed around a useful link because that link is useful

ARPANET v2
----------

- Used latency (queue length) and bandwidth
- This allows for a delay calculation for each link
- `Delay = (DepartTime - ArrivalTime) + TransmissionTime + Latency`
- Worked better, but caused high-traffic links to flap between low and high cost

Adjustments
-----------

- Reduce max cost
- Use link utilization in metric
- Smooth link cost changes

---

![ARPANET Routing Metrics](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-36-9780123850591.png)

---


- A highly loaded link never shows a cost of more than three times its cost when idle
- The most expensive link is only seven times the cost of the least expensive
- A high-speed satellite link is more attractive than a low-speed terrestrial link
- Cost is a function of link utilization only at moderate to high loads

Static Costs
------------

- Modern networks have more consistent bandwidth and latency than ARPANET
- Metrics are often set statically by administrators to something such as `C/link_bandwidth`

3.5 Implementation
==================

Software Switch
---------------

- We can create a switch by adding multiple NICs to a general-purpose computer
- All packets must pass through main memory (max bandwidth ~100Gbps)
- Packets must all be processed by a single CPU

---

![Software Switch](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide14.png)

Hardware Switch
---------------

- Software switches have limited bandwidth
- We can improve the situation by creating dedicated parallel hardware

Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
------------------------------------------------

- Custom silicon
- Can be very fast for a particular purpose
- Expensive to produce
- Time consuming to design

Domain Specific Processors
--------------------------

- Can be an option in network hardware
- Add instructions and hardware for particular domain tasks (e.g. machine learning, video encoding)
- Provide benefits of traditional CPU with better domain performance

---

![Switch architecture](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide22.png)

Network Processing Units
------------------------

- Similar in concept to GPUs but designed for implementing switch backplanes
- Can process many terabits per second of data, far more than we could with a traditional CPU

NPU Benefits
------------

- Very fast SRAM
- Ternary Content Addressable Memory - Packets can be matched at a high rate of speed
- Forwarding is implemented in a parallel pipeline on an ASIC

4.1 Global Internet
===================

---

- Routing as discussed previously provides a somewhat scalable solution for the global Internet
- The modern Internet includes 100,000+ *networks*, so including them all in routing tables is problematic
- We need to create a tighter hierarchy to make the problem more tractable

---

![Internet Tree Structure in 1990](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-01-9780123850591.png)

Scaling Challenges
------------------

- Routing problem size
- IP address space utilization

Routing Areas
-------------

- There are too many individual networks to practically calculate and store routes for all of them
- We group the networks together into areas

Backbone
--------

- Connects areas together
- May be referred to as area 0

---

![Domain divided into areas](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-02-9780123850591.png)

Routing Inside Area
-------------------

- Covered in chapter 3
- Routers exchange link-state packets to learn connections and then calculate shortest paths
- Link-state packets are not passed outside of the area

Border Routers
--------------

- Summarize routes from their area and share information with backbone
- An area may have multiple border routers connected to the backbone
- (R1, R2, and R3 in figure)

Interdomain Routing (BGP)
-------------------------

Autonomous Systems (AS)
-----------------------

- The Internet is organized as a collection of networks controlled by a single administrative entity (large corporation, ISPs, etc)
- Provides additional hierarchy to improve scalability

---

![Two Autonomous Systems](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-03-9780123850591.png){height=540px}

Interdomain Routing Challenges
------------------------------

- Each AS needs to be able to determine its own routing policies
- We want to use our connections for the purpose that we paid for, which may mean avoiding *transit* traffic
- Find non-looping, policy compliant paths

---

![Multi-provider Internet](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-04-9780123850591.png)

AS Types
--------

- Stub - AS with one connection to one other AS
- Multi-homed - AS with connection to multiple AS, but that disallows transit traffic
- Transit - AS with multiple connections designed to carry local and transit traffic, such as a backbone

AS Costs
--------

- Internal route costs are meaningless externally, so we only share reachability as our routing metric

Trust
-----

- We must provide trust in the system
- An AS advertising a route they can't support will break the Internet
- [Example BGP-related outage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/)

Border Gateway Protocol
-----------------------

- Gateway is another name for router
- Protocol handles route communication between AS border routers

---

![Example BGP System](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-06-9780123850591.png)

Route advertisement
-------------------

- BGP speakers advertise complete paths
- Upstream BGP speakers share this information with peers, adding themselves as a hop
- An AS can prevent transit by not advertising available routes that it doesn't want others to use

AS Numbers
----------

- Must be unique
- Currently 32 bit number assigned to an AS

BGP Packets
-----------

- Use TCP for reliability
- May indicate that a route is available or a previous route is withdrawn

---

---

![Common AS relationships](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-08-9780123850591.png)


Complete Routing
----------------

- We can combine interdomain and intradomain routing to deliver a packet from any host to any other host
- BGP is used to determine routes between AS
- Interior Gateway Protocol (IGF), such as RIP or OSPF is used inside AS
