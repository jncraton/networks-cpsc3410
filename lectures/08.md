1.4 Software
============

Sockets
=======

---

Sockets provide a standard interface from the network to our applications

Socket types
------------

- Stream - provides a virtual circuit
- Datagram - delivers individual packets

Socket Implementation
---------------------

- Independent of network type
- Most typically used with TCP/IP and UDP/IP

---

![Socket States](media/socket-states.png)

Echo server example
-------------------

```python
import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 2001))
    s.listen()
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    with conn:
        print('Connected by', addr)
        while True:
            data = conn.recv(1024)
            if not data: break
            conn.sendall(data)
```

Echo client example
-------------------

```python
import socket

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 2001))
    s.sendall(b'Hello, world')
    data = s.recv(1024)
print('Received', repr(data))
```

1.5 Performance
===============

Bandwidth and Latency
=====================

Two measures of performance
---------------------------

- Bandwidth (throughput) - Number of bits per time
- Latency (delay) - Time needed to send

Bandwidth
---------

- Refers to two separate concepts both related to computer networks
- Digital bandwidth (MB/s)
- Analog bandwidth (MHz)

---

Latency
-------

Time it takes for data to arrive

Latency Components
------------------

- Propagation time (Distance / speed of light)
- Transmit time (Size / Bandwidth)
- Queuing delay (related to congestion)

Performance
-----------

- Bandwidth and latency combined tell us a lot about the performance of a channel
- Bandwidth and latency are distinct but often related

Bandwidth Delay Product
=======================

---

![Bandwidth Delay Product](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f01-18-9780123850591.png)

Why calculate bandwidth delay product?
--------------------------------------

- Amount of data sent before any arrives
- Related to window size in transmission protocols

---

Link Type             Bandwidth  One-Way Distance  RTT     RTT x Bandwidth
---------             ---------  ----------------  ---     ---------------
Wireless LAN          54 Mbps    50 m              0.33 Î¼s 18 bits
Satellite             1 Gbps     35,000 km         230 ms  230 Mb
Cross-country fiber   10 Gbps    4,000 km          40 ms   400 Mb

High-speed networks
===================

---

- Network bandwidth continues to increase
- Network latency is bounded by physics

---

![1MB file on 1Mbps vs 1Gbps link](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f01-19-9780123850591.png)

---

As networks become faster, latency become the limiting factor for performance.

---

Any degradation that requires additional round trips will significantly hurt total real bandwidth

Application Performance
=======================

---

Applications may have specific performance requirements

Known application requirements
------------------------------

- Fixed bandwidth (VOIP, video chats, gaming, etc)
- Minimum latency requirements
- Jitter requirements

Jitter
------

- Change in latency from one time to another
- Can cause buffer underflow
- Can cause gaps in voice transmissions
