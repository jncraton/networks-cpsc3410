3.1 Switching Basics
====================

Direct Connections
------------------

- We have assumed up until now that our devices are directly connected
- Ethernet bus
- Wifi radios

Direct Connection Limits
------------------------

- Cable length
- Radio range
- Collision domain size

Internetworking
---------------

- We connect our networks together in order to form the global Internet

Routers
-------

- Operate at layer 3 and may connect networks of different types

Switches
--------

- Operate at layer 2 and connect networks of the same type
- May also be called bridges

Switches
--------

- Multiple-input, multiple-output device
- Transfers packets from an input to one or more output ports

Switch Benefits
---------------

- Can be interconnected to form networks of many hosts
- Can be connected via point-to-point links like fiber to create a geographically large network
- New hosts do not decrease the performance of other hosts

Star Topology
-------------

- Classic Ethernet uses physical bus topology
- This has many weaknesses, including a large collision domain
- Switches allow a star topology which avoids this problem

Classic vs Switched Ethernet
----------------------------

- Classic - Hosts limited to the speed of the medium (10mbps) collectively
- Switched - Hosts limited to the speed of the medium individually
- Switching is far more scalable

Switching Challenges
--------------------

- Identifying hosts - Use addresses
- Determining output for packet

Datagrams
=========

---

Every packet includes info needed to send it to the correct destination

---

Let's look at the forwarding table on switch 2

---

+-------------+------+
| Destination | Port |
+=============+======+
| A           | 3    |
+-------------+------+
| B           | 0    |
+-------------+------+
| C           | 3    |
+-------------+------+
| D           | 3    |
+-------------+------+
| E           | 2    |
+-------------+------+
| F           | 1    |
+-------------+------+
| G           | 0    |
+-------------+------+
| H           | 0    |
+-------------+------+

Datagram Networks
-----------------

- Connectionless (packets can be forward at any time with establishing a connection)
- Hosts don't know if packets can be delivered successfully
- Changes to forwarding table will cause packets to take new paths at any time
- Link failures may not cause downtime if forwarding table can be updated to route around breaks

---

Virtual Circuit Switching
=========================

Connection-oriented
-------------------

- Must setup a connection before data transmission
- Switches create and maintain connection state in a VC table

VC Table
--------

- Unique virtual connection identifier (VCI) included in packet headers
- Incoming interface
- Outgoing interface
- New VCI for outgoing packets

Virtual Circuit Types
---------------------

- Permanent (PVC) - Configured by network administrators
- Switched (SVC) - Configured by host messages on the network (*signaling*)

---

![Example network](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-03-9780123850591.png)

Creating a VC from A to B
-------------------------

Switch 1
--------

+--------------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
| Incoming Interface | Incoming VCI | Outgoing Interface | Outgoing VCI |
+====================+==============+====================+==============+
| 2                  | 5            | 1                  | 11           |
+--------------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+

Switch 2
--------

+--------------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
| Incoming Interface | Incoming VCI | Outgoing Interface | Outgoing VCI |
+====================+==============+====================+==============+
| 3                  | 11           | 2                  | 7            |
+--------------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+

Switch 3
--------

+--------------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+
| Incoming Interface | Incoming VCI | Outgoing Interface | Outgoing VCI |
+====================+==============+====================+==============+
| 0                  | 7            | 1                  | 4            |
+--------------------+--------------+--------------------+--------------+

Management
----------

- For real networks we need tools to manage PVC as the problem quickly becomes complicated
- Signaling can be used in PVC to help admins configure connections

VC Considerations
-----------------

- Requires 1 RTT at minimum before data can be sent using signaling
- VCI (link-local) will be smaller than addresses, saving overhead
- VCs need to recreated when a link fails and torn down to free RAM
- Signaling still requires knowledge of hosts on the network, so it doesn't solve our core routing issues

Resource Allocation
-------------------

- VC networks can limit usage by rejecting new circuits
- We can assign circuits different Quality of Service (QoS)
- Datagram networks have to process packets as they arrive or drop them

Source Routing
==============

---

- Include all data needed for routing in the packet
- Requires additional overhead and complete knowledge of the network

---

![Source routing](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-07-9780123850591.png)

---

Updating Routing Info
---------------------

- Rotate exits
- Strip used exits
- Update pointer to next exit

---

3.2 Switched Ethernet
=====================

Bridges
-------

- Connect network segments
- Hubs or bridges behave as a classic Ethernet bus
- Ethernet networks still operate as a *logical* bus

---

![Bridge example](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-09-9780123850591.png)

Comparison to Repeaters
-----------------------

- Repeaters operate on bits
- Bridges operate on frames
- Bridges are able to overcome the length and collision issues of repeaters
- Bridges require much more digital logic

Bridge Optimizations
--------------------

- If we have sufficient compute, we can inspect frames and make optimizations
- We don't need to forward all packets to everyone

Learning Bridges
----------------

- How can a bridge decide where packets must go?
- Manually configured forwarding table
- Listen to frames and map src addresses to ports
- Store this information in a table

---

+------+------+
| Host | Port |
+======+======+
| A    | 1    |
+------+------+
| B    | 1    |
+------+------+
| C    | 1    |
+------+------+
| X    | 2    |
+------+------+
| Y    | 2    |
+------+------+
| Z    | 2    |
+------+------+

Example forwarding table

MAC table example
-----------------

Call up switch via RS232:

`cu --baud 9600 --line /dev/ttyUSB0`

Show MAC address table on Cisco devices:

`show mac address-table`

ARP Cache vs MAC address table
------------------------------

- An ARP cache maps MAC addresses to IP addresses
- The MAC address table maps MAC addresses to ports
- A modern L3 managed switch will have both

Algorithm
---------

- Add src addresses to table as they are seen
- Expire addresses after a timeout
- Send incoming messages to the correct port if we know it, otherwise broadcast to everyone

Spanning Tree Algorithm
=======================

---

Both broadcasting to everyone and learning bridges create packet storms if the network has a loop.

---

![Ethernet network with loops](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/Slide5.png)

---

- Loops break switched Ethernet networks
- We can design networks without loops
- Is there a problem?

Redundancy
----------

- What if a link fails?
- We'd like a system that allows the network to self-heal while we replace the link

---

![Cyclic graphs and spanning tree](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f03-11-9780123850591.png)

Algorithm
---------

- Root node is elected. It will forward on all ports.
- Each switch computes its shortest path to the root and uses the port on that path for forwarding.

---

Broadcast and Multicast
=======================

---

- Broadcast and multicast are trivial to support 
- We transmit to everyone
- Multicast could be better optimized, but it is rarely used in practice and is often simply implemented as broadcast, leaving hosts to discard frames not intended for them

Virtual LANs (VLANs)
====================

Problem
-------

- Switches reduce the collision domain for unicast traffic
- Broadcast traffic is still sent to every host on the network
- Networks are still not fully scalable

Virtual LAN
-----------

- Tag ports as being members of a separate networks
- Reduces size of broadcast domain

---

802.1q
------

- Adds support for VLAN tagging on Ethernet networks
- Creates additional header field for VLAN ID
