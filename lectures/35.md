World Wide Web
==============

---

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a system of documents and other resources that are linked together via Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). These resources may be interlinked by hypertext.

---

URL
---

- protocol - https://
- host - example.com
- path - /index.html

Web Pages
---------

- Contain hypertext documents represented as HTML
- Typically delivered using HTTP
- Documents may link to one another using hypertext
- A useragent (commonly a browser) accesses pages

Hypertext
---------

```html
<html>
<body>
<a href="https://example.com/mypage.html">
<img src="https://example.com/photo.jpg">
</body>
</html>
```

Hypertext Transfer Protocol
---------------------------

- Used to transfer web content
- Unencrypted by default
- Supports actions against URLs using verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE

Transport Layer Security
------------------------

- Provides an encrypted connection much like a TCP socket
- Keys are created during handshake
- Identity of server may be verified using public key cryptography (certificate)

QUIC and HTTP/3
---------------

- TLS and TCP both require handshakes
- These can be combined to reduce latency
- QUIC was proposed in 2012 to address this and has now been adopted as part of HTTP/3

QUIC Performance
----------------

- Can improve latency by 10-30%

The Deep Web
------------

- Any one of several networks that operates on top of the traditional internet to provide encrypted transport, relative anonymity, and various services
- Provides more privacy than the regular web
- Is relatively small
- May be used to evade legal restrictions, at least for a time

The Onion Router (Tor)
----------------------

- Probably the most popular anonymity service
- Makes use of hosts on the Internet to relay information
- Data is routed through several hosts with a layer of encryption being removed at each level
