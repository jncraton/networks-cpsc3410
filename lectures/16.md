3.2 Switched Ethernet
=====================

Brigdes
-------

- Connect network segments
- Hubs or bridges behave as a classic Ethernet bus
- Ethernet networks still operate as a *logical* bus

Comparison to Repeaters
-----------------------

- Repeaters operate on bits
- Bridges operate on frames
- Bridges are able to overcome the length and collision issues of repeaters
- Bridges require much more digital logic

Bridge Optimizations
--------------------

- If we have sufficient compute, we can inspect frames and make optimizations
- We don't need to forward all packets to everyone

Learning Bridges
----------------

- How can a bridge decide where packets must go?
- Manually configured forwarding table
- Listen to frames and map src addresses to ports
- Store this information in a table

ARP Cache vs MAC address table
------------------------------

- An ARP cache maps MAC addresses to IP addresses
- The MAC address table maps MAC addresses to ports
- A modern L3 managed switch will have both
