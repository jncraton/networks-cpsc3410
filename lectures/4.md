Layering and Protocols
======================

---

What is abstraction?

---

Abstraction is the hiding of implementation details behind an interface

---

Networks have many complex details that we would like to abstract or hide.

---

Layering
--------

- We combine the network communication tasks into **Layers** with well-defined interfaces

---

---

Any given layer may have multiple implementations that implement the same basic services.

Protocols
---------

- The abstract objects making up the layers of the network stack
- Agreement on how communication should take place
- 

Protocol Interfaces
-------------------

- Service interface - Provides interface for use on the local machine
- Peer interface - Determines messaging and communication with the remote host

---

---

Except at the hardware level, peer interfaces are indirect and must use other layers of the stack to communicate

Protocol Specifications
-----------------------

- Abstract documents that define how communication should work
- Created and maintained by standards bodies (IETF, ISO, etc)
