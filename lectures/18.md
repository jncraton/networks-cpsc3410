Internetwork
------------

- Join networks across locations
- Join networks across media types

Key Idea: IP allows networks of different types to be interconnected

Service Model
=============

Host services
-------------

- Addressing scheme
- Datagrams with best-effort delivery
- Packet delivery is not guaranteed

Datagram
--------

- Connectionless packet sent over network
- Includes enough information to get it to its destination
- Best-effort delivery
- Will be sent over other protocols (e.g. Ethernet)

Fields
------

- Version - specifies protocol version, such as 4. This comes first so that the rest of the header can be changed in future versions
- HLen - Header length
- TOS (type of service) - Used by some QoS implementations

Fields
------

- Length - total length including header
- Ident, flags, offset - Used for reassembling fragmented packets
- TTL (time to live) - Number of hops before packet is discarded

Fields
------

- Protocol - Higher-level protocol used (TCP, UDP, etc)
- Checksum - Simple additive 16-bit checksum, not as strong as CRC

Fields
------

- Source address
- Destination
- Variable numbers of options
- Padding
