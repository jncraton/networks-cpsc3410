Error Detection and Correction
==============================

Error Correcting codes
----------------------

- Carry enough information to fix errors
- Usage referred to as forward error correction (FEC)

Error Detecting Codes
---------------------

Carry enough information to detect errors

---

As a general rule, the more lossy a channel is, the more we gain from investing in forward error correction.

---

Error models
------------

- Single bit
- Bursts

Erasure channel
---------------

Some physical transmission will note when a bit was unable to be read

Usage of error detection and correction
---------------------------------------

Error correction and detection can happen at many different levels of the network stack from physical up to application.

Error Detection
---------------

Parity
------

- Linear, systematic block code
- Single bit appended to bitstream to make number of 1s even (or odd)
- Single parity bits have a disance of 2

Parity
------

- Simple
- Low-overhead (1 bit per block)
- Only detects single bit errors

Handling Burst Errors with Parity
---------------------------------

- Burst errors are only detected with 50% accuracy
- We could add addition parity bits

Interleaving
------------

- To optimally detect burst errors, we'd prefer parity bits to not be generated in the order that data appears on the wire
- We'd like to interleave data before parity calculations to detect burst errors

Hamming Code
------------

- Error correcting

Convolutional Code
------------------

- Error detecting
