Global Addresses
================

Flat Addresses
--------------

- We need a unique global identifier
- MAC addresses are unique, but they are also *flat* meaning they can't easily be mapped to a hierarchical network structure.

Hierarchical Addresses
----------------------

- IP addresses are hierarchical
- The parts of the address correspond to a network, then to a host on that network

Datagram Forwarding
===================

Assumptions
-----------

- Every Datagram contains a destinaton address
- The network portion of the IP address identifies a single network
- All host within a network can communicate directly
- Every network has a router that can exchange packets with other networks

Forwarding
----------

- Determine if we are on the same network as the destination address by comparing to addresses on own interfaces
- If on same network, deliver directly
- If not on same network, forward packet to appropriate router

Forwarding Table
----------------

- Forwarding table will list possible routers
- (NetworkNum, NextHop) pairs
- Individual hosts will often have only a single default router

Forwarding Table Example
------------------------

```
route -n
```

Route Example
-------------

```
traceroute -n 1.1.1.1
```

Subnetting and Classless Addressing
===================================

Address Classes
---------------

- Address space is limited
- Inefficiently use address space
- We can use subnetting for greater granularity

Routing
-------

- We need to adjust forwarding tables slightly to use subnetting
- Use (SubnetNumber, SubnetMask, NextHop) tuples

---

+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| SubnetNumber  | SubnetMask      | NextHop     |
+===============+=================+=============+
| 128.96.34.0   | 255.255.255.128 | Interface 0 |
+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| 128.96.34.128 | 255.255.255.128 | Interface 1 |
+---------------+-----------------+-------------+
| 128.96.33.0   | 255.255.255.0   | R2          |
+---------------+-----------------+-------------+

Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)
------------------------------------

- Address space usage is still not ideal, particularly for fowarding
- We can combine subnets together into a supernet

---

Notation
--------

- 1.1.1/24 (Class C address)
- Equivalent to 255.255.255.0 Subnet

Address Translation (ARP)
=========================

---

How do we know where an IP address is on our local network?

Use IP address as local addresses
---------------------------------

- This can be done
- Limits the size of network addresses
- Can't work with 48 bit Ethernet addresses
- Rarely done in practice

Store Mappings
--------------

- Could be centrally maintained
- Could be maintained automatically

ARP
---

- Maintains addresses table (ARP Cache)
- Cache values are evicted by timeout
- If a needed value is not present in the cache, an ARP broadcast message is used to learn it

---

Wireshark Example
-----------------

- Use `arp` filter
