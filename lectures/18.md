Error Detection and Correction
==============================

Error Correcting codes
----------------------

- Carry enough information to fix errors
- Usage referred to as forward error correction (FEC)

Error Detecting Codes
---------------------

Carry enough information to detect errors

---

As a general rule, the more lossy a channel is, the more we gain from investing in forward error correction.

---

Error models
------------

- Single bit
- Bursts

Erasure channel
---------------

Some physical transmission will note when a bit was unable to be read

Usage of error detection and correction
---------------------------------------

Error correction and detection can happen at many different levels of the network stack from physical up to application.

Hamming Code
------------

- Error correcting

Convolutional Code
------------------

- Error detecting
