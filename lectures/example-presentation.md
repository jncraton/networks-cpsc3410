Functions
---------

- Telemetry
- Command
- Tracking
- Radio science
- Radar mapping

Complexes
---------

> Each of the three Deep Space Network, or DSN, sites has multiple large antennas and is designed to enable continuous radio communication between several spacecraft and Earth. 

Complexes
---------

> All three complexes consist of at least four antenna stations, each equipped with large, parabolic dish antennas and ultra-sensitive receiving systems capable of detecting incredibly faint radio signals from distant spacecraft.
