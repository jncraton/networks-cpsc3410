4.2 IP Version 6
================

IP Version 4
------------

- Still used by most hosts on the Internet
- Limited to 32-bit addresses (4 billion unique address)

---

IP Upgrade
----------

- Growing address size requires new version of IP protocol and associated network hardware upgrades
- It made sense to include other new features while updating the protocol

IPv6 Features
-------------

- Autoconfiguration
- Enhanced routing
- Compatibility with IPv4 during transition period

IPv6 Addresses
--------------

- 128 bits long
- Support embedding 48-bit link-local addresses

---

+-----------------+---------------------+
| Prefix          | Use                 |
+=================+=====================+
| 00…0 (128 bits) | Unspecified         |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 00…1 (128 bits) | Loopback            |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1111 1111       | Multicast addresses |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1111 1110 10    | Link-local unicast  |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| Everything else | Global Unicast      |
+-----------------+---------------------+

Notation
--------

- Typically 8 groups of 4 hex characters
- For example: 47CD:1234:4422:ACO2:0022:1234:A456:0124
- Runs of zeroes may be omitted (47CD::A456:0124)
- IPv4 over IPv6 may be written as ::FFFF:128.96.33.81

Global Unicast Addresses
------------------------

- Support hierarchical routing by default
- Leverage extra bits to create cleaner format and networking boundaries

---

IPv6 Packet Format
------------------

- Updates version field to 6
- Removes rarely used features
- Adds longer addresses
- Improves option parsing via static ordering

---

Fragmentation
-------------

- We try to avoid fragmentation whenever possible
- We move fragmentation information out of standard headers and into options to save space in the common case

Autoconfiguration
-----------------

- Advanced feature of IPv6
- Allows creating local addresses without DHCP
- We can create link-local addresses using a prefix and MAC address

---

+-----------------+---------------------+
| Prefix          | Use                 |
+=================+=====================+
| 00…0 (128 bits) | Unspecified         |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 00…1 (128 bits) | Loopback            |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| 1111 1111       | Multicast addresses |
+-----------------+---------------------+
|**1111 1110 10** | Link-local unicast  |
+-----------------+---------------------+
| Everything else | Global Unicast      |
+-----------------+---------------------+

Source-Directed Routing
-----------------------

- Allow individual packets to specify which networks they should pass through
- Can be used to balance cost and quality of service requirements

4.3 Multicast
=============

Multicast
---------

- There are applications, such as live broadcasts, that can benefit from sending traffic to multiple hosts
- Sending a packet to multiple hosts is known as multicasting

Multicast Addresses
-------------------

- There are special address ranges in IPv4 and IPv6 reserved for multicasting
- Hosts can configure there NICs to listen to multicast addresses of interest

Multicast Uses
--------------

- Typically limited to niche applications
- LAN IP TV broadcasts
- Internal communication on multimedia CDNs

Multicast on the Internet
-------------------------

- Requires more complex routing
- Creates new attack surface for denial-of-service
- Rarely used in practice

Multicast Routing
-----------------

Not covered in this class.

4.4 Multiprotocol Label Switching
=================================

4.5 Routing Among Mobile Devices
================================

Mobile Challenges
-----------------

- The Internet was designed for stationary devices
- Addresses are based on location and network
- Moving around will necessarily change your address and break existing connections

---

![Forwarding packets from a correspondent node to a mobile node](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-26-22092018.png){height=540px}

Security
--------

- We can simply send a message to the correspondent node updating our address
- How would they be able to trust that it is really us?
- This mechanism could be used for MitM attacks

Two Functions of Addressing
---------------------------

- Identification - Who are we talking to?
- Location - How do we route packets to them?

TCP
---

- Connections assuming IP addresses do not change
- TCP is difficult to replace or change

Connection Handling
-------------------

- Application can check the state of connections and recreate them as needed
- This is the approach used by HTTP 

Mobility and Wireless
---------------------

- Wireless devices don't necessarily exhibit mobility as described here
- A device moving around campus connecting to different APs is physically mobile, but it is not changing networks or IP addresses
- *Mobility* would take place if the device transitioned from campus Wifi to a cell tower

Mobility Agents
---------------

- In order to facilitate consistent connections, we can build a system of agents on top of our existing networks

---

![Mobility host and agent](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f04-27-9780123850591.png)

Challenges
----------

1. How does the home agent intercept a packet that is destined for the mobile node?
2. How does the home agent then deliver the packet to the foreign agent?
3. How does the foreign agent deliver the packet to the mobile node?

Solutions
---------

- Proxy ARP
- Tunneling

Weaknesses
----------

- Can be slow
- Can use very poor routes
