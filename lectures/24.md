Wireless LAN Protocols
======================

---

Collision detection is difficult because we aren't the receiver


Hidden terminal problem
-----------------------

A node that we can't hear is transmitting to our receiver

Exposed terminal problem
------------------------

A node that we can hear is transmitting to someone else

Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
----------------------------------------

- Transmit short frame (RTS)
- Receiver transmits short frame to connected clients letting them know the carrier is about to be busy (CTS)
