4.3 Multicast
=============

Multicast
---------

- There are applications, such as live broadcasts, that can benefit from sending traffic to multiple hosts
- Sending a packet to multiple hosts is known as multicasting

Multicast Addresses
-------------------

- There are special address ranges in IPv4 and IPv6 reserved for multicasting
- Hosts can configure there NICs to listen to multicast addresses of interest

Multicast Uses
--------------

- Typically limited to niche applications
- LAN IP TV broadcasts
- Internal communication on multimedia CDNs

Multicast on the Internet
-------------------------

- Requires more complex routing
- Creates new attack surface for denial-of-service
- Rarely used in practice

Multicast Routing
-----------------

Not covered in this class.

4.4 Multiprotocol Label Switching

4.5 Routing Among Mobile Devices
================================

Mobile Challenges
-----------------

- The Internet was designed for stationary devices
- Addresses are based on location and network
- Moving around will necessarily change your address and break existing connections

Security
--------

- We can simply send a message to the correspondent node updating our address
- How would they be able to trust that it is really us?
- This mechanism could be used for MitM attacks

Two Functions of Addressing
---------------------------

- Identification - Who are we talking to?
- Location - How do we route packets to them?
