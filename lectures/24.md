4.4 Multiprotocol Label Switching
=================================

Mobile Challenges
-----------------

- The Internet was designed for stationary devices
- Addresses are based on location and network
- Moving around will necessarily change your address and break existing connections

Security
--------

- We can simply send a message to the correspondent node updating our address
- How would they be able to trust that it is really us?
- This mechanism could be used for MitM attacks

Two Functions of Addressing
---------------------------

- Identification - Who are we talking to?
- Location - How do we route packets to them?
