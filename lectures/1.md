Functions
---------

- Telemetry
- Command
- Tracking
- Radio science
- Radar mapping

Complexes
---------

> Each of the three Deep Space Network, or DSN, sites has multiple large antennas and is designed to enable continuous radio communication between several spacecraft and Earth. 

Complexes
---------

> All three complexes consist of at least four antenna stations, each equipped with large, parabolic dish antennas and ultra-sensitive receiving systems capable of detecting incredibly faint radio signals from distant spacecraft.

Locations
---------

- Australia (near Canberra)
- Spain (near Madrid)
- United States (California)

Antennas
--------

- Each complex has a 70-meter antenna and several smaller antennas
- The large antenna weighs 2,970 tons.
