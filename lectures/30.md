Transport Layer
===============

---

> The transport layer builds on the network layer to provide data transport from a process on a source machine to a process on a destination machine with a desired level of reliability that is independent of the physical networks currently in use.

Layers
------

- Application
- Transport <-- We are here
- Network
- Link
- Physical

Transport Entity
----------------

Software and hardware in the transport layer that provides efficient and reliable data transmission to processes at the application layer.

Types of Service
----------------

- Connection oriented
- Connectionless

Why do we need the transport layer?
-----------------------------------

- Doesn't the network layer already provide many of these services?
- Couldn't it be amended to include the missing services?

Transport Layer Implementation
------------------------------

- Transport layer is implemented in hosts
- Network layer is implemented in routers
- The transport layer provides an API for programs in our system to access the network in well-defined way

A programmer's view layers
--------------------------

- Transport Service User
  - Application Layer
- Transport Service Provider
  - Transport, Network, Link, and Physical Layers
