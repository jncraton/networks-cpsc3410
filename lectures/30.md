Lab Questions

6.2 Queuing Disciplines
=======================

Routers
-------

- Maintain queues of packets to be forwarded
- The design and use of these queues is a queuing discipline

FIFO
----

- First-in, first-out
- Packets are forwarded in the order they arrive

---

Fairness
--------

- FIFO allocates packets based on arrival
- A host sending a lot of data will dominate the link
- Hosts sending little data will experience high latency

Fair Queuing
-------------

- Use buffers for each flow
- Send packets in FIFO order per flow in round-robin fashion

Packet Sizes
------------

- Packets may be different sizes
- We must account for this in order to ensure fairness
- This makes the simple round-robin example a bit more complicated

Properties
----------

1. *Work conserving* - The link will be active as long as there is a packet in the queue
2. Flows may use only 1/n of the link bandwidth when the link is full

Weighted Fair Queuing
---------------------

- We can assign weights to flows to give them more or less bandwidth
- Weights can be determined in various ways (hosts, traffic type, etc)
- Weights can ultimately be used to shape traffic and provide differing quality of service

6.3 TCP Congestion Control
==========================

Overview
--------

- CongestionWindow is managed by sender to limit packets in flight and transmission speed

Congestion Window
-----------------

- Set based on perceived network congestion
- Packet timeouts are used to adjust window size
- Additive Increase/Multiplicative Decrease

Window Adjustment
-----------------

- Halve windows size on each timeout
- Add 1 to window size on each successful round trip
- In practice, window size is increased by a small fraction of MSS for each ACK

Slow Start
----------

- TCP originally sent as many packets as the advertised window would allow when starting connections
- This caused congestion issues, and the behavior was changed to double the congestion window on each ACK at the start of a connection
- Slow start is also used when the connection is dead after waiting for a timeout
