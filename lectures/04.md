1.2 Requirements
================

---

- We want to understand how to build a network from the ground up
- We must understand the design of modern networks, but it is also important to consider first principles and how we got here

Stakeholders
============

---

In considering how and why networks are the way they are, it is critical to consider the people involved with them

Users
-----

- Define the needs and use cases for the networks

Application Programmer
----------------------

- Defines specific application level network services
    - Guaranteed delivery
    - Continuous connectivity and roaming
    - Speed requirements

Network Operator
----------------

- Defines characteristics of overall system to make it manageable
    - Handling hardware failure
    - Configuration management
    - Usage restrictions, monitoring, and accounting

Network Designer
----------------

- Defines properties for a cost-effective design
    - Fairness of usage
    - Performance
    - Price
    - Physical media

Scalable Connectivity
======================

---

- A network must provide connectivity among computers
- Sometimes it is useful to have limited networks (corporate networks, campus networks, etc)
- Usually though, we want to *scale* to an arbitrary size

Hierarchy
---------

- We have to approach connectivity from multiple levels

Links
-----

- Physical connections (wires, rf) between devices create a *link* between *nodes*
- Links may be points-to-point or multiple-access
- Often seen as the *last mile* connections (Wifi, Cable, DSL, FTTH, etc)

---

Scaling Links
-------------

- A single physical connection is very limiting in terms of geographic area and number of hosts it can serve
- Fully connected networks require too many connections in most applications
- Connected hosts can cooperate to form larger networks of indirect connectivity

Switched Network
----------------

- Group of nodes that connect to forward data
- May be *packet switched* or *circuit switched*

---

![switched network](media/1-3.png)

Store-and-forward
-----------------

- Common packet switched network implementation
- Nodes receive a full packet of data, then forward it to the appropriate next hop on the network

Internetworking
---------------

- We frequently connect separate networks together (such as the AU campus network and your home network)
- This is known as internetworking
- Routers or gateways handle passing packets between the networks

Addressing
----------

- We have shown that we can build up a large network using interconnected nodes
- Hosts on the network still need to be able to refer to one another
- The system by which hosts refer to one another is known as *addressing*

Addresses
---------

- Typically represented as a unique byte string
- Messages typically include source and destination addresses
- *Routing* allows messages to be forwarded to the correct host

Multiple destinations
---------------------

- We may want (or need) to send data to multiple hosts
- Unicast - send to one host
- Multicast - send to a group of hosts
- Broadcast - send to all hosts

Big idea
--------

- Networks are defined recursively
- This hides complexity, overcomes physical limitations, and makes the overall system manageable

Cost-effective resource sharing
===============================

---

- Focusing on a packet switched network, we can see that resources (such core links) are constantly being shared
- How do we ensure that shared resources are used fairly?

---

![Synchronous Time-division multiplexing (STDM)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Telephony_multiplexer_system.gif)

Frequency division multiplexing
-------------------------------

- Breaks link into subchannels, and used on for each device
- You're familiar with this in TV and radio
- Wifi channels are also an example

Weaknesses
----------

- Both FDM and STDM waste available resources
- Bandwidth is reserved for all hosts, even when they don't need it
- Number of flows must be known in advance

Statistical multiplexing
------------------------

- Link is shared over time
- Data is transmitted from each flow on demand without waiting for hosts with nothing to say
- One flow may only consume the link for a given amount of time

Quality of Service (QoS)
------------------------

- Various algorithms can be chosen to determine who sends on the medium
    - First-in, first-out (FIFO)
    - Flow-based round-robin
    - Much more complex algorithms

Big idea
--------

Statistical multiplexing allows fair sharing of a link

Support for Common Services
===========================

---

We don't merely want to send packets around, we want to provide service that make it easy to build applications

Channels
--------

- We think of the network as providing *channels* for individual applications to communicate
- Layering is used to create this channel abstraction on top of packet-switched networks

Channel needs
-------------

- Reliability - Do messages need to arrive?
- Privacy - Can other see our messages?
- Ordering - Do messages need to arrive in the order they were sent?

Big idea
--------

Different applications will have different needs, so we need to design different abstractions that work well for them.

Manageability
=============

---

Networks have to be managed and maintained

Common tasks
------------

- Replacing hardware
- Adding hosts
- Troubleshooting issues

Self-healing designs
--------------------

- Allow humans to be removed from the loop, or at least have a less urgent role

Change management
-----------------

- There is often a tension between *feature velocity* and *stability*
- Any time something is changed, there is a chance that it will cause breakages
