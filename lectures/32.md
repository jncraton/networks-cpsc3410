6.5 Quality of Service
======================

QoS
---

- Applications have different needs
- A network that supports these different needs is said to support Quality of Service (QoS)

Requirements
------------

- Bandwidth
- Latency
- Jitter
- Packet loss

---

![Audio Example](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f06-20-9780123850591.png)

Buffering
---------

- Audio is broken into time slices and sent as packets
- Packets are buffered and played back

---

Buffer size
-----------

- A larger buffer will be more resistent to jitter and possibly packet loss
- A larger buffer also induced delay

---

Application Needs
-----------------

- Real-time vs elastic
- Intolerant to packet loss
- Able to adapt to different level of bandwidth by adjusting rate
- Able to adapt to jitter and latency using larger buffers

QoS Approaches
--------------

- Fine-grained - make adjustments by flow or application
- Course-grained - provides different levels of services to large classes of data
