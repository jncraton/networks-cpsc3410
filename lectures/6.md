1.5 Performance
===============

Bandwidth and Latency
=====================

Two measures of performance
---------------------------

- Bandwidth (throughput) - Number of bits per time
- Latency (delay) - Time needed to send

Bandwidth
---------

- Refers to two separate concepts both related to computer networks
- Digital bandwidth (MB/s)
- Analog bandwidth (MHz)

Latency
-------

Time it takes for data to arrive

Latency Components
------------------

- Propogate time (Distance / speed of light)
- Transmit time (Size / Bandwidth)
- Queueing delay (related to congestion)

Performance
-----------

- Bandwidth and latency combined tell us a lot about the performance of a channel
- Bandwidth and latency are distinct but often related

Bandwidth Delay Product
=======================

Why calculate bandwidth delay product?
--------------------------------------

- Amount of data sent before any arrives
- Related to window size in transmission protocols
