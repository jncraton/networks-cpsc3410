2.4 Error Detection
===================

Errors
------

- Data errors at the physical level are unavoidable
- Data errors at the software level are unacceptable

Link Types
----------

- Fiber - very low error rate on good links
- Copper - very low error rate, but somewhat worse than fiber
- RF - bit errors and long strings of errors are probable

Handling errors
---------------

1. Detect that an error has occurred
2. Ask for retransmission

Simple error detection
----------------------

- Send message twice
- Confirm that both copies are identical

Simple error detection
----------------------

- 2x overhead
- A 2-bit error could be undetected

Overhead
--------

- We want to be able to add k bits to an n bit message in a way that can detect the most possible errors

Parity
------

- Adds a single bit to a message that makes the total number of 1s odd or even
- Will catch any odd number of bit error (1, 3, etc)
- Will miss any even number of bit errors
- Used in RS232

Checksum
--------

- Error detecting code involving addition

Checksum Process
----------------

- Treat each word in the message as a number
- Add the words and transmit their lowest k-bits as the checksum
- Confirm that the checksum matches when receiving frames
- Catches most errors, but will still miss errors that "cancel out"\

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
-----------------------------

- Provides a division-like check function
- Efficient to implement in hardware
- Can be tuned by selecting different polynomials
- CRC32 is used in Ethernet

CRC as a hash function
----------------------

- CRC is effectively a hash function
- It's not designed as a *cryptographic* hash function
- It's not  designed to prevent intentional collisions, but simply to detect random errors
- Do not use it as a cryptographic hash function

Error Correction
================

Hamming Codes
-------------

- A mechanism to correct errors in transmission using overlapping parity bits
- Provides relatively simple ECC example
- Used in ECC RAM

2.5 Reliable Transmission
=========================

Errors
------

- Bitstreams may have errors
- Errors can be detected using CRCs or other mechanisms
- Errors are relatively expensive to repair

Layer
-----

- Reliable transmission may be provided by the link layer
- It may also be provided by higher layers
- The basic techniques are the same

Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)
------------------------------

- Sender - Aknowledge when data arrives
- Receiver - Timeout if no acknowledgement
- Retransmission can be used to provide correct data

Stop and wait
=============

---

- After sending a frame, we wait for acknowledgement before sending another
- Retry sending after a timeout and no acknowedgement

---

This seems simple. What can go wrong?

Duplicate frames
----------------

- If we acknowledge a frame, but the ack doesn't arrive in time, the frame will be retransmitted
- This will appear to be a *new* frame, causing data duplication
- We can solve this using 1-bit sequence number

Stop and wait limitation
------------------------

Our max data rate will be capped by our frame size and RTT

Key idea
--------

Our delay bandwidth product represents the amount of data we need to be able to send without acknowledgement to optimize throughput

Sliding Window
==============

---

- Send multiple frames at once
- Wait for acknowledgements before sending more
- Adjust window size as needed

Sender Algorithm
-----------------

- Assign unique and incrementing SeqNum value to frames
- Send window size (SWS) - limits outstanding frames
- Last acknowledgement recieved (LAR) - SeqNum of last ACK
- Last frame sent (LFS) - SeqNum of last sent frame
- $LFS - LAR \le SWS$ must always be true

---

![Sliding Window](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-20-9780123850591.png)

Sender Algorithm
----------------

- When ACK arrives LAR is incremented appropriately and a frame is sent
- Timeouts are used to retransmit frames that aren't acknowledged
- The senders must buffer SWS previous frames

Receiver Algorithm
------------------

- Receive window size (RWS) - upper bound of out-of-order frames to accept
- Largest acceptable frame (LAF) - SeqNum of the highest frame we would accept
- Last frame received (LFR) - SeqNum of the last frame received
- LAF - LFR <= RWS will always be true

---

![Receiver sliding window](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-21-9780123850591.png)

Receiver algorithm
------------------

- If LFR < SeqNum <= LAF an incoming frame can be accepted. Otherwise, it is dropped
- Send and ACK for the highest SeqNum for which all lower frames have been correctly received

Out of order packets
--------------------

- No ACK for packets that come early, but buffer them
- Cummulative ACK when appropriate
- We could send a negative acknowledgement when we miss a packet, but we typically don't as it adds additional overhead

Out of order packets
--------------------

- These are impossible on most point-to-point links (aside from retransmission due to errors)
- They become possible as systems get more complex and packets can take multiple routes to a destination

Selective Acknowledgement
-------------------------

- Acknowledge every frame, as opposed to cummulative acknowledge where we batch acknowledgement for previous frames
- Adds complexity
- Increases traffic
- May improve overall throughput, as retransmission can happen faster

Window size
-----------

- Ideal sender window is related to bandwidth delay product
- Receiver window can be 1 to not require buffer and drop out of order packets
- RWS can be equal to SWS to appropriately buffer any packets that are usable
- RWS > SWS is not meaningful

Sequence number overflow
------------------------

- On real networks, the sequence number is finite size (e.g. 8 bits)
- Smaller sizes reduce overhead, but require reuse to happen sooner
- The max safe SWS we can use is half of the MaxSeqNum + 1 on a point-to-point link
- If frames can be reordered in transit, we need a more comprehensive solutions

Sliding Window Protocol Benefits
--------------------------------

1. Reliable delivery over unreliable channel
2. Reordering for out-of-order frames
3. Basic flow control
