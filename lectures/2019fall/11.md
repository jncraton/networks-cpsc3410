Wireless Transmission
=====================

Repeaters
---------

- May be used to boost a signal after some distance
- Must be used in some form to route around Earth's curvature

Frequency allocation
--------------------

- "Beauty contest" - Prone to bribery and corruption
- Lottery - Prone to profiteering
- Auction - Organizations must pay billions

ISM Bands
---------

- Unlicensed
- Power limited by law
- 900 MHz, 2.4Ghz, 5GHz, 60GHz

802.11ad
--------

- Operates at 60GHz
- Transfer rates of ~7 Gb/s
- Ratified by the IEEE in 2012

Infrared Transmission
---------------------

- Used by TV remotes
- Can't pass through any line of sight blockers
- Has been used for computer device communication

Light Transmission
------------------

- Focus and aim narrow lasers at a distant detector
- Blocked by line of sight
- Can be very high bandwidth

Communication Satellites
========================

Basic concept
-------------

- Radio transmission gets blocked by surface interference, so we place repeaters in the sky

Transponder
-----------

- Recieves incoming transmissions and rebroadcasts on another frequency
- Lacks intelligence
- Referred to as a "bent pipe"

Basic orbital mechanics
-----------------------

- Can't escape gravity by going up
- Counter gravity by going sidways ($\Delta v$)
- Higher orbits require higher $\Delta v$
