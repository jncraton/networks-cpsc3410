Elementary Data Link Protocols
==============================

Ideal channel
-------------

- No errors
- No processing limitations
- Channel always open

Handling limited processing
---------------------------

Stop-and-wait waits for a frame to be acknowledged before sending another.

Handling Loss
-------------

- Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)
- AKA Positive Acknowledgement with Retransmission (PAR)
- Requires adding sequence numbers to header in case ACK is lost

Timer
-----

Required to handle retransmission in case of missing ACK

Piggybacking
------------

Temporarily delay acks until we have a packet to send

Sliding Window Protocols
========================

One-bit Sliding Window
----------------------

Same as stop and wait

---

---

One bit sliding window is bottlenecked by latency

Wireshark Example
-----------------

Bandwidth delay product
-----------------------

Bandwidth in bits/s multiplied by one way transit time

Appropriate window size
-----------------------

- 2BD + 1
- Where BD is the bandwidth delay product in frames
- The 2 is due to round trip delay
- The 1 is because we send an ack frame in addition to our data

Optimal Link Utilization
------------------------

$\textrm{link utilization} \leq {w \over 1 + 2BD}$

Pipelining
----------

Multiple frames are kept in flight
