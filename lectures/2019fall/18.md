Error Detection and Correction
==============================

Error Detecting Codes
---------------------

Carry enough information to detect errors

Error Correcting codes
----------------------

- Carry enough information to fix errors
- Usage referred to as forward error correction (FEC)

---

As a general rule, the more lossy a channel is, the more we gain from investing in forward error correction.

---

Error models
------------

- Single bit
- Bursts

Erasure channel
---------------

Some physical transmissions will note when a bit was unable to be read

Usage of error detection and correction
---------------------------------------

Error correction and detection can happen at many different levels of the network stack from physical up to application.

Error Detection
---------------

Parity
------

- Linear, systematic block code

Linear code
-----------

Can be computed using linear functions quickly in hardware

Block code
----------

- Check bits are computed solely from data bits
- Check bits could be looked up in a table

Systematic code
---------------

- Data bits are sent directly with check bits without the data bits being encoded

---

Most codes we look at will be linear, systematic block codes

Parity
------

Single parity bits have a disance of 2

Hamming Distance
----------------

Number of bit flips needed to convert one code into another

Parity 
------

Single bit appended to bitstream to make number of 1s even (or odd)

Parity
------

- Simple
- Low-overhead (1 bit per block)
- Only detects single bit errors

Codeword
--------

Data + check

RAID Example

Handling Burst Errors with Parity
---------------------------------

- Burst errors are only detected with 50% accuracy
- We could add addition parity bits

Checksum
--------

A group of check bits associated with a message

Interleaving
------------

- To optimally detect burst errors, we'd prefer parity bits to not be generated in the order that data appears on the wire
- We'd like to interleave data before parity calculations to detect burst errors

Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)
-----------------------------

- Polynomial Code
- Different properties based on chosen polynomials
- CRC used in Ethernet detects all bursts < 32 bits and all bursts impacting an odd number of bits
