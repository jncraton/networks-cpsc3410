Sliding Window
==============

---

- Send multiple frames at once
- Wait for acknowledgements before sending more
- Adjust window size as needed

Sender Algorithm
-----------------

- Assign unique and incrementing SeqNum value to frames
- Send window size (SWS) - limits outstanding frames
- Last acknowledgement recieved (LAR) - SeqNum of last ACK
- Last frame sent (LFS) - SeqNum of last sent frame
- $LFS - LAR \le SWS$ must always be true

---

Sender Algorithm
----------------

- When ACK arrives LAR is incremented appropriately and a frame is sent
- Timeouts are used to retransmit frames that aren't acknowledged
- The senders must buffer SWS previous frames

Receiver Algorithm
------------------

- Receive window size (RWS) - upper bound of out-of-order frames to accept
- Largest acceptable frame (LAF) - SeqNum of the highest frame we would accept
- Last frame received (LFR) - SeqNum of the last frame received
- LAF - LFR <= RWS will always be true

Receiver algorithm
------------------

- If LFR < SeqNum <= LAF an incoming frame can be accepted. Otherwise, it is dropped
- Send and ACK for the highest SeqNum for which all lower frames have been correctly received

Out of order packets
--------------------

- No ACK for packets that come early, but buffer them
- Cummulative ACK when appropriate
- We could send a negative acknowledgement when we miss a packet, but we typically don't as it adds additional overhead

Out of order packets
--------------------

- These are impossible on most point-to-point links (aside from retransmission due to errors)
- They become possible as systems get more complex and packets can take multiple routes to a destination

Selective Acknowledgement
-------------------------

- Acknowledge every frame, as opposed to cummulative acknowledge where we batch acknowledgement for previous frames
- Adds complexity
- Increases traffic
- May improve overall throughput, as retransmission can happen faster

Window size
-----------

- Ideal sender window is related to bandwidth delay product
- Receiver window can be 1 to not require buffer and drop out of order packets
- RWS can be equal to SWS to appropriately buffer any packets that are usable
- RWS > SWS is not meaningful

Sequence number overflow
------------------------

- On real networks, the sequence number is finite size (e.g. 8 bits)
- Smaller sizes reduce overhead, but require reuse to happen sooner
- The max safe SWS we can use is half of the MaxSeqNum + 1 on a point-to-point link
- If frames can be reordered in transit, we need a more comprehensive solutions

Sliding Window Protocol Benefits
--------------------------------

1. Reliable delivery over unreliable channel
2. Reordering for out-of-order frames
3. Basic flow control

2.6 Multi-access networks
=========================

Multi-access
------------

- Hosts share the same link

CSMA/CD
-------

- We need to ensure the channel is quiet before sending (carrier sense)
- We need to stop transmitting if someone else start (collision detection)

History
-------

- Basic algorithm similar to ALOHA
- Used in older Ethernet, but not in modern switched Ethernet
- Used in modern 802.11

ALOHA
-----

- Send data if you have it to send
- Listen to transmission rebroadcast. If it is not your message, you need to resend

Slotted ALOHA
-------------

- Introduce time slots for transmission

Physical Properties
===================

---

![Ethernet Bus](https://book.systemsapproach.org/_images/f02-22-9780123850591.png)

Bus
---

- All hosts are connected to the same medium
- If hosts use the medium at the same time, collisions will occur
- We need to minimize collisions while maximizing time that the bus is active to maximize throughput


Repeaters
---------

- Forward signals between networks
- Allow larger Ethernet networks
- Can create very large broadcast domain

Broadcast
---------

- All host receive all frames
- Hosts compete for bandwidth
