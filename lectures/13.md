2.7 Wireless Networks
=====================

Wireless Differences
--------------------

- In most cases, links are broadcast
- Collisions are very likely
- Sources of errors are abundant

Frequency Use
-------------

- RF collisions between all sorts of devices are possible
- Governments typically slice up the spectrum and allocate it for various purposes
- In the US, the FCC handles these allocations

Frequency Licenses
------------------

- Many frequency bands require an explicit license
- Even unlicensed bands require rules to be followed to limit interference, such as a maximum legal transmission frequency

Base Stations
-------------

In most network designs, we have a device generically referred to as a base station that has a high-bandwidth link to the network and wirelessly serves other clients.

Mesh networks
-------------

- Lack a central base station
- Wireless communication between all nodes

802.11
======

Wifi
----

- Commonly use to cover small geographic area (homes, offices, etc)
- Can be operated without a license

Main standards
--------------

- 802.11b - 11mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz
- 802.11a - 54mbps max data rate, 5GHz
- 802.11g - 54mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz
- 802.11n - 150mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz (40MHz channel, no MIMO)
- 802.11ac - 867mbps 2.4Ghz and 5GHz (8 antenna AP, 160MHz channel)

Bitrate negotiation
-------------------

- Bitrates can be adjusted in response to surrounding noise and interference

Improvements over time
----------------------

- Improved hardware and encoding/decoding techniques
- Channel bonding
- MIMO

MIMO
----

- Multiple input, multiple output
- Uses arrays of antennas and interference patterns to create multiple spatial streams

---

Real speed increases
--------------------

- Many increases in performance are hard to realize
- Some require uncongested areas
- Some require signal quality that is difficult to realize in reality in order to negotiate the highest rates

Collisions
---------

How do we make ourself heard while avoiding talking over others?

Collision detection
-------------------

- In Ethernet we can listen to our bus to know if it is in use
- We can't do this perfectly when communicating with a wireless base station

Collision Avoidance
-------------------

We need a mechanism to prevent collisions the we can't observe ourselves

Request to send
---------------

- When we have data to send, we send and RTS packet to the base station including the amount of time that we need
- The base station responds with a CTS packet letting us know we can proceed
- Network Allocation Vector (NAV) - Hosts on the network track time until it is available by observing RTS and CTS frames

RTS Collisions
--------------

- RTS frames may collide
- This is identified by lack of CTS
- Backoff then occurs before retry

Distribution System
===================

Base stations
-------------

- 802.11 can be used for ad-hoc networks, but it usually involves one or more base stations or APs
- In networks with multiple APs, APs are networked together via a distribution system

---

Joining a network
-----------------

1. Node sends `Probe` frame
2. APs respond with `Probe Response` frame
3. Node selects AP and sends `Association Request` frame
4. The AP replies with an `Association Response` frame

Mobility
--------

- Nodes may choose to drop their associated AP and associate with a new one
- This process is the same as the initial process to join the network

---

Passive scanning
----------------

- `Probe` frames are used for active scanning
- We can also passively listen for `Beacon` frames sent at regular intervals by the AP

Frame Format
============

---

Multiple Addresses
------------------

- We need additional addresses in the frame to handle cases where we are sending
- Transmitter Address (TA)
- Receiver Address (RA)
- Source Address (SA)
- Destination Address (DA)

Wifi Security
-------------

- All traffic is broadcast over the air and is vulnerable to eavesdropping
- We will discuss adding encryption to secure wireless channels in chapter 8

Bluetooth
=========

---

- Operates at 2.45 GHz
- Connect devices at short range
- Headsets, mice, etc
