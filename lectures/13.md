2.7 Wireless Networks
=====================

Wireless Differences
--------------------

- In most cases, links are broadcast
- Collisions are very likely
- Sources of errors are abundant

Frequency Use
-------------

- RF collisions between all sorts of devices are possible
- Governments typically slice up the spectrum and allocate it for various purposes
- In the US, the FCC handles these allocations

Frequency Licenses
------------------

- Many frequency bands require an explicit license
- Even unlicensed bands require rules to be followed to limit interference, such as a maximum legal transmission frequency

Base Stations
-------------

In most network designs, we have a device generically referred to as a base station that has a high-bandwidth link to the network and wirelessly serves other clients.

Mesh networks
-------------

- Lack a central base station
- Wireless communication between all nodes

802.11
======

Wifi
----

- Commonly use to cover small geographic area (homes, offices, etc)
- Can be operated without a license

Main standards
--------------

- 802.11b - 11mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz
- 802.11a - 54mbps max data rate, 5GHz
- 802.11g - 54mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz
- 802.11n - 150mbps max data rate, 2.4GHz (40MHz channel, no MIMO)
- 802.11ac - 867mbps 2.4Ghz and 5GHz (8 antenna AP, 160MHz channel)

Bitrate negotiation
-------------------

- Bitrates can be adjusted in response to surrounding noise and interference

Improvements over time
----------------------

- Improved hardware and encoding/decoding techniques
- Channel bonding
- MIMO

Real speed increases
--------------------

- Many increases in performance are hard to realize
- Some require uncongested areas
- Some require signal quality that is difficult to realize in reality in order to negotiate the highest rates

Collsions
---------

How do we make ourself heard while avoiding talking over others?

Collision detection
-------------------

- In Ethernet we can listen to our bus to know if it is in use
- We can't do this perfectly when communicating with a wireless base station
