2.7 Wireless Networks
=====================

Wireless Differences
--------------------

- In most cases, links are broadcast
- Collisions are very likely
- Sources of errors are abundant

Frequency Use
-------------

- RF collisions between all sorts of devices are possible
- Governments typically slice up the spectrum and allocate it for various purposes
- In the US, the FCC handles these allocations

Frequency Licenses
------------------

- Many frequency bands require an explicit license
- Even unlicensed bands require rules to be followed to limit interference, such as a maximum legal transmission frequency

Base Stations
-------------

In most network designs, we have a device generically referred to as a base station that has a high-bandwidth link to the network and wirelessly serves other clients.
