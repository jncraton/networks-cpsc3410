Quality of Service
==================

---

How do we handle services that need stronger guarantees from the networks?

Overprovisioning
----------------

Simply install more hardware than the network needs

QoS considerations
------------------

1. What applications need from the network.
2. How to regulate the traffic that enters the network.
3. How to reserve resources at routers to guarantee performance.
4. Whether the network can safely accept more traffic.

Flow
----

Stream of packets from one destination to another

Flow needs
----------

Needed quality of service determined from:

- Bandwidth
- Delay
- Jitter
- Loss
