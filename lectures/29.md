6.1 Issues in Resource Allocation
=================================

Resource Allocation
-------------------

- Pocess by which network elements try to meet the competing demands that applications have for network resources
    - Link bandwidth
    - Router/switch buffer space

Congestion Control
------------------

- Efforts made by network nodes to prevent or respond to overload conditions
- Congestion is bad for everyone
- The goal should be to eliminate or even prevent it

Flow Control
------------

- Congestion control deals with the network as a whole
- Flow control deals with a pair of hosts not overwhelming one another

Packet-Switched Network
-----------------------

- Multiple links connected to deliver packets
- Hosts and routers do not have complete infromation about available bandwidth of the network

Connectionless Flows
--------------------

- IP packets are routed independently
- It is useful to consider packets between a pair of hosts following a similar route as a single *flow*

Soft State
----------

- State that does not need to be explicitly created and destroyed via signalling
- Most routers maintain soft state about flows to aid in resource allocation

Characteristics
---------------

- Router-Centric versus Host-Centric
- Reservation-Based versus Feedback-Based
- Window Based versus Rate Based
